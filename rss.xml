	<title>JSON RPC 2.0 - for simple and powerful APIs</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-03-09-json-rpc-2-for-simple-and-powerful-apis.html</link>

Some of them I have caused, some of them I helped to resolve and in some of them I was a mere bystander.

This post is the distilled essence on how different teams that I had the pleasure of being a member, dealt and deal with the stress and the specific characteristics of these tense situations to ensure timely and proper resolution.</description>
