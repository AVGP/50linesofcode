	<title>JSON RPC 2.0 - for simple and powerful APIs</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-03-09-json-rpc-2-for-simple-and-powerful-apis.html</link>
	<description>To my surprise a contender in the field of API protocols is yet unknown: JSON-RPC 2.0.
A standard since 2010, it is simple yet powerful but barely known amongst developers.
This article explains what it is, what makes it different and nice to work with and how to use it.</description>

	<title>Five rules to stay levelheaded and efficient when handling downtimes</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-03-17-five-rules-to-stay-levelheaded-and-efficient-when-handling-downtimes.html</link>
	<description>Downtimes, Crashes, Incidents, System Failures - they have many names, but most people involved with technology to some degree have experienced at least one at some point in their career.

I've seen many different teams and many different incarnations of the above-mentioned situations. I've been on the different sides of them: The user, the developer, the system administrator, the site reliability engineer and the consultant.

Some of them I have caused, some of them I helped to resolve and in some of them I was a mere bystander.

This post is the distilled essence on how different teams that I had the pleasure of being a member, dealt and deal with the stress and the specific characteristics of these tense situations to ensure timely and proper resolution.</description>

	<title>Slick and slf4j MDC logging in Scala</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-07-01-slick-and-slf4j-mdc-logging-in-scala.html</link>
	<description>* Multi-user applications need log messages to retain **context**, so the situation can be examined on a transaction-basis
* The **mapped diagnostic context**, short `MDC`, allows to put context to all log statements for a single thread
* Scala allows us to build an `ExecutionContext` where we can copy the `MDC` to any new thread that is being used giving us **multi-thread MDC logging**
* Slick requires us to also provide an `Executor` that uses this `ExecutionContext`
* There's a package for that: `de.geekonaut.slickmdc`</description>

	<title>The overwhelming web</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-07-04-the-overwhelming-web.html</link>
	<description>Web Development can be pretty strange these days.

On the one hand we tell beginners that they need ALL the things:
build tools, task runners, package managers, frameworks, polyfills, libraries, runtimes and
deployment systems.

On the other hand some are airing their concerns about some flavour of "fatigue",
be it a framework, library, JavaScript or even frontend fatigue.

I also noticed a sense of urgency for *everything*. Mobile-first, Offline-first, Accessibility-first, Content-first and the list goes on. It starts to feel like "everything-first", which of course really would mean: Nothing first.

Where are the olden days, where all you needed to build websites was a text editor and some space online to put it?</description>

	<title>HTML, DOM and JavaScript unraveled</title>
	<link>https://50linesofco.de/2016-10-16-html-dom-and-javascript-unraveled.html</link>
	<description>The web platform has started out with HTML to allow users to share documents
and link them in a user friendly and standardised way.

HTML alone was lacking the possibility to influence the way things looked, so
a new standard came about ([after other alternatives have been proposed](https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/)), CSS.

Around the same time (depending on what you consider the beginning of CSS's existence)
[JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript)
and a few years later a way to interact with the HTML document from JavaScript was created, the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).

Today, the different technologies may be a little too much to take in at first
and it won't get easier as things such as the Shadow DOM is added and frameworks and libraries may bring a Virtual DOM along.

So let's dive right in an have a look at the different bits and pieces that are at play here.</description>
