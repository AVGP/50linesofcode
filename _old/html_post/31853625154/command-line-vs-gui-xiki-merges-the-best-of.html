<h1>Command line vs. GUI - Xiki merges the best of both worlds</h1><p>2012-09-19 10:00:30 GMT</p><article><p>I often hear people say &ldquo;The console is so much faster and much better than any graphical interface in the world!&rdquo; and as frequently as that I hear people say &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that on the command line, this graphical interface is much easier and more comfortable!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally, I switch a lot between graphical interfaces and the command line. Why? Because I don&rsquo;t evangelize about it - I need to get a job done. Sometimes getting something done is faster on the console, sometimes it is easier to use a GUI.</p>
<p>Here is an example: I am perfectly fine with SSHing to a server and use vim there to edit some configuration files, updating the system, searching logs, debugging things, etc.</p>
<p>But on the other hand IDEs such as Eclipse, Netbeans, Springsource are more comfortable for a lot of other tasks- they offer me a huge number of tools comfortably at my fingertips. Refactoring? Easy. Rename a whole package and any references to it? Easy!</p>
<p>Doing that with the command line is not impossible, but it is a little more tricky than clicking a button.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Here comes Xiki!</strong></p>
