<h1>Matrix.js - fancy background with JS and CSS</h1><p>2012-01-30 13:02:05 GMT</p><article><p>Some days ago I wrote a little script to create a animated, matrix-alike background using CSS and JS.</p>
<p>If you want to see how that could look, visit <a href="http://www.geekonaut.de" target="_blank">geekonaut.de</a>.</p>
<p>It works by prepending a number of divs containing a number of spans. Each span holds either a &ldquo;0&rdquo; or a &ldquo;1&rdquo; (chosen by random). The number of divs and spans depends upon window size.</p>
<p>Additionally a window.setInterval is set up to randomly choose one of the spans to change it&rsquo;s content to 0 or 1 (random again) and brighten the color. Plus: It checks, that every 50 times this happens, the first number that is still brighter is reset to the original color.</p>
