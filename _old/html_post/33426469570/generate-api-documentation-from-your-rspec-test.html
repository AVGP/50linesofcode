<h1>Generate API documentation from your RSpec test cases</h1><p>2012-10-12 12:57:22 GMT</p><article><p>Writing API docs can be tedious work, especially when your API is under active development.</p>
<p>New methods are added frequently and from time to time an existing method changes slightly - writing and adapting the docs may slow down your pace.</p>
<p><strong>Automate your API documentation</strong></p>
<p>If you are using RSpec for your tests, you will love the <a href="https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation">rspec_api_documentation</a>Â gem!</p>
<p>It brings in an additional DSL to RSpec, so that you can write test cases with example request and parameter documentation and automatically transfer them into very neat API docs.</p>
<p><strong>Automated awesomeness</strong></p>
<p>The resulting API docs are well-structured, comprehensive and extensive, <a href="http://rad-example.herokuapp.com/docs">as seen in this example</a>.</p>
<p>As a Bonus, the docs can also be delivered in text form through Curl requests and as a super bonus you can have a <a href="https://github.com/tildewill/wurl">Wurl</a> API playground inside your docs to try out your API (see below).</p>

<p>To get all this, you just need to run &ldquo;rake docs:generate&rdquo;, which also runs the test cases your API docs are build upon!</p></article>
