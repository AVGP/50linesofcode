<h1>Android Speech Control</h1><p>2011-02-08 01:00:00 GMT</p><article><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been creating an Android App to enable fully adaptable speech-command-control for my phone.</p>
<p>The App is called &ldquo;Geniedroid&rdquo; and can be customized to react on any keyword you want with a variety of different actions:</p>
<ul><li>Call: You can call a predefined contact or the contact mentioned after the keyword.</li>
<li>SMS: Go to the SMS composer to compose an SMS for the contact mentioned after the keyword or a predefined contact.</li>
<li>Run: Run the app previously linked to that keyword in the config.</li>
<li>Search: Do a web-search for the term mentioned after the keyword or perform a predefined query.</li>
</ul><p>The keywords itself are chosen by you. For example, you may bind the keyword &ldquo;Photo&rdquo; to launching the camera-app - or you may prefer linking this action to the keyword &ldquo;Cam&rdquo;. Its up to you!</p>
<p>If you want to give it a try, <a href="http://www.file-upload.net/download-3160627/GenieDroid.zip.html">you can find the file here</a>. GenieDroid is tested with Android 2.1 - may run with lower versions.</p></article>
