<h1>How not to suck on presentations</h1><p>2012-06-29 13:57:02 GMT</p><article><p>I have been giving and listening to a bazillion of presentations and talks.</p>
<p>And it makes me really sad to see bad presentations. Not just because they&rsquo;re bad and you&rsquo;re likely to lose time there - but because I think those presentations could have been so much better by just doing a few really simple things a bit better.</p>
<p>Usually, when it comes to this, people say you have to have &ldquo;talent&rdquo;. I disagree.</p>
<p>Talent helps you to give extraordinary talks, of course. But giving a good talk does not need talent but practice and knowledge about the pitfalls.</p>
<p>So here we go:</p>

<p><strong>1. The reader</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re (most likely) not talking to little kids in preschool age. Your audience is usually capable of reading on their own. Please don&rsquo;t just read your slides. Provide only the key points of your talk on the slides, but build whole sentences and interesting additional information around it - talk about that, not just about the key points. And don&rsquo;t cheat here (I&rsquo;ve seen people having a keypoint like &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; and telling the audience: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s intuitive.&rdquo; and going on with the other keywords like that.</p>

<p><strong>2. The story</strong></p>
<p>Talks should evolve. Give a motivation for your talk at the beginning to have your audience knowing why they should pay attention to your following presentation - if they have a really good example or a highly incentive reason for your story, they will be more likely to really follow you there.</p>
<p>Also please tell a story - behave like you&rsquo;re telling someone you know really good about your topic. You don&rsquo;t stop every few sentences, wait a few seconds and then start like there was nothing before. Connect your slides with some sentences, pick up things you mentioned early (not too often, though).</p>

<p><strong>3. Acting</strong></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the born actress or actor.</p>
<p>A lot of people find it hard to speak to a larger group of people. Advices like &ldquo;imagine them naked&rdquo; do not work - so what to do?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about getting nervous. It is completely normal. I haven&rsquo;t seen a single speaker so far, who was not nervous at when she or he began their talk. I am freaking out when I enter the stage, believe me.</p>
<p>The trick is: Don&rsquo;t think about your audience. Just see them as a single person, who begged you for the information you will give in your talk. After all: They decided to visit your talk and if they don&rsquo;t like it, they can leave at any time.</p>
<p>(Side node: If I know my audience is forced to be there, I tell them to ask questions or tell me, when they get bored. Wasting people&rsquo;s time always sucks)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy. Look at them, try to make them interact with you (raising hands works best.)</p>
<p>And most important: Talk to them, if they are a person you know. Don&rsquo;t just stand somewhere on the stage, trying to blend in with the wall behind you. Move - walk around (having a presenter to switch slides is wonderful), do some gestures with your hands, modulate your voice. Nothing is worse than a robotic presenter staying around like a statue, monotonously blabbering thru the slides. <strong>Talk with them</strong>.Â </p>
<p>A presentation is like a talk <strong>without anyone interrupting you</strong>. Use that chance and finally tell them all about the topic you are presenting. They won&rsquo;t interrupt you. They let you finish. That&rsquo;s a <em>bonus</em>!</p>

<p>Following along with these few simple steps and practicing them, your talks will be better and people will like them!</p></article>
