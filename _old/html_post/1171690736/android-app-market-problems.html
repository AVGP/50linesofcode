<h1>Android App Market Problems</h1><p>2010-09-23 06:08:32 GMT</p><article><p>Recently I had some trouble downloading apps from the Market.</p>
<p>Every download I started, hung shortly after with &ldquo;Download starting&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Searching the web brought up advices like &ldquo;Set Google Talk to invisible, then to available again&rdquo; and things like that. I have to confess: I did several things in a particular order, so I can only make some guesses. I&rsquo;ll cover them all below.</p>

<ul><li>First possible solution: Get another google-account. You don&rsquo;t need to delete the old one, just disable synchronization for a moment. I registered a completely new account from scratch, directly after this the problem was gone.</li>
<li>Second possible solution: If you&rsquo;re only on WiFi (and behind a NAT [i.e. a router]) try allowing traffic on Port 5228 (I set both, TCP and UDP). So you basically need a port-forwarding.</li>
<li>Third possible solution: Clear the cache and/or data of the download manager and the market, then try again</li>
<li>Forth possible solution: Shout at the Market for not working. Take away his gameboy, if neccessary ;)</li>
</ul><p>I hope that this&rsquo;ll help the people with this problem, since googling brought up more questions, then giving answers&hellip;</p>

<p>Stay tuned</p>
