<h1>Code quality for Ruby and Rails</h1><p>2012-10-01 14:14:42 GMT</p><article><p>When you write web applications with Ruby and Rails, you may be already pretty happy about the amount of tooling you have there: <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> and many, many more.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Interesting things first: The toolset for ruby QA</strong></p>
<p>The first tool you will want to have a look at, if you&rsquo;re writing Rails applications is the <a href="https://github.com/railsbp/rails_best_practices">rails_best_practices gem</a> or <a href="http://railsbp.com/">their neat web</a> service to check your Rails app for accordance with the best practices the project collects for Rails. The web service makes it especially easy as long as you have a (public or private) repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>That one is easy to use and pretty useful to maintain the basic style, but for a deeper analysis there is <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/excellent">excellent</a>, which looks for a bunch of code smells (aka &ldquo;nasty lines&rdquo;) in your source files.</p>
<p>Also useful (but I haven&rsquo;t tried them yet): </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi">Roodi</a> which resembles PMD - a code smell detector. It has a a broader ruleset compared to excellent, though it was broken when I installed it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flog">Flog</a> - scores your code based upon an <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbcMetric">ABC metric</a>. The produced score seems quite abstract and is hard to relate to.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek">Reek</a> is another code smell detector, like Roodi. It works good but has a <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/code-smells">limited catalog of checks</a> at the time of this writing, like excellent.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Style guides, best practices and standards</strong></p>
<p>The tools usually are using Coding Standards for the given languages to tell &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; apart.</p>
<p>For Ruby those standards are still emerging so there is nothing official yet, however there is a bunch of <a href="http://rails-bestpractices.com/">Best Practices for Rails</a> and the Excellent project has some <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/excellent/wiki">code smell checks</a> on their wiki and a lot of different guides:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://pub.cozmixng.org/~the-rwiki/rw-cgi.rb?cmd=view;name=RubyCodingConvention">Ruby Coding Conventions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby Style Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml">Unofficial Ruby Usage Guide</a></li>
</ul><p><strong>Different languages, different tool chains - excursion: QA in PHP/Java</strong></p>
<p>When you come from the Java or the PHP world, you will recall tools like Coverty or Sonar, PMD, CheckStyle and FindBugs.</p>
<p>These are static code analysis tools - and they&rsquo;re not limited to static languages, because they&rsquo;re based on the source code (which may let them miss out some stuff that happens dynamically though). For PHP those tools can be found combined in the <a href="http://phpqatools.org/">PHP QA Toolchain</a>.</p></article>
