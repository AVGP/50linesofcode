<h1>Open source: Go contribute. Now!</h1><p>2013-03-28 10:00:40 GMT</p><article><p>You&rsquo;re still here, reading this article?</p>

<p>Well, that means you&rsquo;re probably like me a few years ago.
You think <strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for that&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;I am not good enough to contribute&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t code at all&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>All of those things <strong>are no excuse</strong>.</p>

<p>First: About the <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<p>I guess you have a lot of things to do then, right? And I bet you wrote a few scripts (be it a tiny 2 liner or a huge collection of shell scripts) to speed up the chores, right?<br/><strong>Publish them. Now.</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need to polish them or write 100 pages of manual texts. Just throw in a readme with two lines (what it does and how to execute it) and publish it.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t wanna &ldquo;clutter&rdquo; your account with a repository or the script is just one clever line of shell code, you can also use <a href="http://www.coderwall.com">Coderwall</a> or a <a href="http://gist.github.com">Gist</a>.</p>

<p>Why you should publish things like that, you ask? Because even if you think it&rsquo;s a very specific solution for a very special problem, others may encounter it. And if so, your tool can help them get it done quicker.</p>

<p>Another case is when you do a little modification to an existing tool, because it makes it a little easier to use or a little faster or even fixes a bug - <strong>publish it</strong>, so that others can benefit just like you did by using the tool in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Contributing often only takes a few minutes</strong> and often you just need to put it online somewhere (with things like <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> available, this is no big deal anymore!) - and you should do so, even if it&rsquo;s not <em>polished</em>.</p>

<p>I see it pretty often that people postpone their contribution, because it needs to be cleaned up, documented or polished in whatever way.
<strong>Publish the raw gem that you have</strong> - and <em>then</em> you can polish it later.
Maybe even other people <strong>polish it for you</strong>.</p>

<p>Next one: <strong>You are good enough and you will learn something from contributing</strong>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s really just two things that can happen: Your code is good enough. And it&rsquo;s a great feeling, when it gets accepted into a tool or library you use in your daily work.</p>

<p>The other case is, that your code isn&rsquo;t good enough. In that case you get invaluable feedback on why it isn&rsquo;t good enough and how to improve. That, in the long run, makes you a better programmer. It&rsquo;s pretty much <strong>free training</strong>. Use this opportunity by contributing code.</p>

<p>Alright - last one.<br/>
You can&rsquo;t code? So what?<br/>
Often the documentation of a project has missing or outdated parts. Fill them with the knowledge you gained while using the tool.</p>

<p>Another way of contributing is joining the forums, mailing list or user group or stackoverflow of the project to answer questions of others.</p>

<p>You should understand that <strong>contributing is a small thing to do</strong> with a <strong>big impact</strong>.</p>
