<h1>Programming the TI83+ in Assembler using Linux</h1><p>2011-02-06 11:40:00 GMT</p><article><p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>
<p>A few days ago I rediscovered my Texas Instruments &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83">TI 83 Plus</a>&rdquo; graphical calculator.</p>
<p>It is based upon <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z80">Zilons Z80</a> CPU. The TI83+ runs on 6 MHz and is capable of displaying pixel-graphics. It can be programmed using a special BASIC-favor, using C (haven&rsquo;t really figured that out, yet) or z80 Assembly. </p>
<p>I remembered the days back in school, when I used the TI-BASIC to extend the calc&rsquo;s capabilities - for example to render 3D-Vectors to be abled to illustrate and review results of vector-geometrical assignments.</p>
<p>Besides that, I built a variety of programs for convenience in plain &ldquo;use that formula, substitute the variables according to the task and give the result.&rdquo; - for example for <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process">Bernoulli-Processes</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway. Currently, I would like to play with Z80 Assembly on it. To get that running, I started reading some articles and got several different results. All differ a bit here and there and it took me some time to get going.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how you get going easily:</strong></p>
<p>I am using Debian Linux but the setup should be the same for all distributions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need the following tools:</p>
<ul><li>spasm: The Assembler (Just get <a href="http://wabbit.codeplex.com/releases/view/45275">Wabbitcode</a> to fetch it.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ticalc.org/pub/unix/tilp.tar.gz">tilp</a>: The TI-Link Program for Linux (use &ldquo;apt get install tilp2&rdquo;, if you&rsquo;re Debian user)</li>
<li>The text-editor of your choice. (only if you don&rsquo;t work in Wabbitcode)</li>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://education.ti.com/downloads/files/computer_software/sdk_83p/ti83plus.inc">ti83plus.inc</a> File.</li>
</ul><p>You can - of course - also use Wabbitcode, which is an IDE for TI-Assembly.</p>
<p>Now you have two possible options to build the .8xp-File (the binary):</p>
<ol><li>Use Wabbitcode</li>
<li>Use your favorite text-editor and spasm directly.</li>
</ol><p>Whatever way you choose, after building the *.8xp-File, you need to transmit it to the calculator using tilp. I will describe the second method.</p>
<ul><li>You create your code file, say &ldquo;hello.asm&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Write your code - <a href="https://gist.github.com/812603">here is an example</a>. Be sure to have an empty line at the end of the file!</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>Run spasm with &ldquo;spasm hello.asm hello.8xp&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Start tilp. Perform a left-click on the left panel, click &ldquo;Change device&rdquo; and choose the right settings for you.</li>
<li>Transfer the hello.8xp to the calculator.</li>
<li>Run it on the calculator by using Asm(prgmHELLO) and enjoy.</li>
</ul><p>Thats it!</p></article>
