<h1>Tumblr-Meetup Zurich, October 1st, 2012</h1><p>2012-09-23 14:01:00 GMT</p><article><p>Hey folks!</p>
<p>The Interwebs is cool and all, but how about a coffee together?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s do it. You don&rsquo;t have to be on Tumblr to join, of course - but I suggest a little meetup in Zurich, at <a href="http://www.steinfels-zuerich.ch/">Steinfels</a> (near Hardbr√ºcke) to have a little chat and find out, how is hanging around the area! Expand your network, discover the faces and people behind the bits&amp;bytes.</p>
<p>If you want to come, please <a href="http://twitter.com/AVGP">tell me on Twitter</a> or just react to this post. Sharing is caring and especially appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>The meetup will be at Steinfels Zurich at 8pm.</strong></p></article>
