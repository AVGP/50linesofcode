<h1>Finding out all the licenses of your dependencies</h1><p>2014-01-03 15:22:50 GMT</p><article><p>A while ago I wondered if, with all the dependencies creeping into software I build, I&rsquo;m not violating a GPL license hidden somewhere.</p>

<p>I turned to npm and Rubygems on the quest to fix this potential issue only to find that neither <code>bundler</code> nor <code>gem</code> or <code>npm</code> allow me to find out in a painless way.</p>

<p>So I built a small ruby script to parse Gemfiles (and recently added <code>package.json</code> support for npm) and tell me the licenses.</p>

<p>For NPM this is surprisingly boring and easy, as npm gives you the &ldquo;MIT&rdquo; license as the default when creating a new module - but in the Ruby world the journey is more cumbersome as there&rsquo;s no default license.</p>

<p>After running the script against a bunch of projects I incorporated an additional mechanism to try to figure out more licenses and <em>today I want to invite you to give it a go, too</em></p>

<p>You can find the script on the <a href="https://github.com/martin-naumann/all-your-licenses">all-your-licenses Github repository</a> and install the few dependencies it has with bundler, then run it with</p>

<p><code>$ ruby main.rb -f /path/to/Gemfile_or_package.json</code></p>

<p>Have fun and don&rsquo;t violate any licenses anymore ;-)</p>
