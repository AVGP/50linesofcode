<h1>Running your meteor.js application on your own server</h1><p>2013-03-12 12:00:50 GMT</p><article><p>During the course of the weekend two weeks ago, I created the **<a href="http://quantified.geekonaut.de">Quantified Geekonaut</a> to gather some data about my internet activities (such as Twitter, Last.FM [Spotify really], Foursquare, Github, my blog and a few others) and experiment with graphing and such.</p>

<p>I decided to build it with <a href="http://www.meteor.com"><strong>Meteor.js</strong></a> - primarily because I needed a reason to play around with it again.</p>

<p>One thing I found (without being too surprised about it) about hosting your app on the <strong>free meteor.com cloud hosting</strong> is, that it gets restarted whenever somebody accesses your website.</p>

<p>Which isn&rsquo;t a problem normally is an issue for the <em>Quantified Geekonaut</em> application, because it gathers data periodically and saves it to be able to graph and query historical data points. That&rsquo;s obviously impossible, if it only collects data when accessed by a visitor.</p>

<p>As Meteor gives you the possibility to <strong>bundle your app</strong> as a (more or less) self-contained node.js app, you could as well <strong>run it on your own server</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll give a quick run-through on how to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Bundle your app</strong></p>

<p>To bundle your meteor app, run</p>

<pre><code>meteor bundle app.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>and copy the app.tar.gz on your server.</p>

<p><strong>Optional: Install nvm and node.js v0.8</strong></p>

<p>To run a meteor.js application you need to have at least node.js version 0.8.<br/>
Optionally, if you want to use different node.js versions in parallel, you could install nvm, the Node Version Manager (pretty much &ldquo;RVM&rdquo; for node).
To install nvm on your server, you just run</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
curl <a href="https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh">https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh</a> | sh
</code></pre>

<p>to make bash always load nvm on startup, use</p>

<pre><code>echo "source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh" &gt;&gt; .bash_rc
</code></pre>

<p>on your server. If you&rsquo;re not using bash as your shell, adjust that accordingly.</p>

<p>To install node 0.8 on your server you just run</p>

<pre><code>nvm install v0.8
</code></pre>

<p>which gets you the latest stable version of the 0.8 branch. To make node 0.8 your default node.js version (if you have more than just this one), run</p>

<pre><code>nvm alias default 0.8
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2: Unpack the bundle on your server</strong></p>

<p>Pretty straight forward: Copy the bundle from Step 1 to your server and run</p>

<pre><code>tar xvf app.tar.gz
cd bundle
</code></pre>

<p>** If you bundled your app on a different architecture than your servers&rsquo; (e.g. you bundled the app on OSX and run your server on Linux or your server is a 64bit system and your computer is a 32bit system) you need to reinstall fibers:</p>

<pre><code>cd server
rm -rf node_modules/fibers
npm install fibers@1.0.0
cd ..
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3: Install forever</strong></p>

<p>If you have your app running, you want to make sure it keeps running.
<a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">Forever</a> is a great tool for that.<br/>
It runs a node.js app in the background, monitors it and restarts it when needed.
To install forever, run</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g forever
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Optional: Get a MongoHQ database</strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to setup and install your own MongoDB instance, check out <a href="https://www.mongohq.com/home">MongoHQ</a>. You can use their free sandbox DB, if you wish. Copy the Mongo-URL to use it with meteor.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Set the environment and start the app</strong></p>

<p>For this you need a connection URL to a mongo db. You can either set it up manually or you can use MongoHQ as described above.
The app needs the URL of a MongoDB and a port to run on. To specify these run</p>

<pre><code>export PORT=8080
export MONGO_URL=mongodb://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;db_host&gt;:&lt;db_port&gt;/&lt;db_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please substitute <code>user</code>,<code>password</code>,<code>db_host</code>,<code>db_port</code> and <code>db_name</code> with values for your Mongo instance.<br/>
Now you can start the app with</p>

<pre><code>forever start main.js
</code></pre>

<p>Your app should now be reachable on Port 8080 on your server&rsquo;s address!</p>

<p><strong>Optional: Setup reverse proxy with Apache</strong><br/>
If you want to run the app on a subdomain of your server, let&rsquo;s say
<code>meteorapp.example.com</code> and you already have an Apache running for the main domain and/or some VirtualHosts, you can create a reverse proxy to serve the meteor app with something like this in your apache <code>sites</code> folder (for Debian that is <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled</code>).<br/>
Create a new vhost file with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName meteorapp.example.com
  ProxyRequests off
  &lt;Proxy *&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  &lt;/Proxy&gt;

  &lt;Location /&gt;
    ProxyPass http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8080/
  &lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and you&rsquo;re ready to go. Reload apache with</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
</code></pre>

<p>or similar for your server OS and you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy meteor running on a subdomain.</p></article>
