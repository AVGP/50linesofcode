<h1>New experiment: Record screen and webcam from your browser</h1><p>2014-02-28 11:00:00 GMT</p><article><p>Thanks to an experimental feature in Google Chrome, you can use <code>getUserMedia</code> to capture your screen - put that together with your webcam stream and record it as a video from within the browser - et voila: An interesting experiment was born.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>Take a look at my quick demo:</p>

<h2>A rabbit hole called development</h2>

You know that, right? You face a challenge you want to tackle, only to find out that there&rsquo;s a myriad other, related challenges to be tackled first.</p>

<p>This is how this experiment came to live&hellip;</p>

<h2>How to capture your screen with web technologies</h2>

<p>I recently stumbled upon an <a href="https://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/getusermedia/screenshare.html">experimental Chrome feature for capturing your screen with getUserMedia</a> and so I thought: Sweet, that&rsquo;d give a great screencast recording tool.</p>

<p>Now for a screencast to be a little more personal and relatable, I find it nice to see the person talking me through something - and the web has me covered!</p>

<p>I just request the video stream from the web cam and put it together (picture-in-picture) with the video stream from the screen capture.</p>

<h2>Recording from getUserMedia</h2>

<p>Alright, now I can see myself and my screen. That&rsquo;s cute but only mildly useful - I&rsquo;d need to record it.<br/>
Again the web has me covered&hellip; sorta&hellip;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/streams/StreamProcessing.html#canvas-recording">StreamProcessing</a> is including a piece for recording video and audio. But I don&rsquo;t know any browser supporting it today.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/media-stream-capture/MediaRecorder.html">MediaRecorder</a> proposal&hellip; but documentation is rare for this.</p>

<p>So I had to look for some other way to get to something quickly.</p>

<h2>Whammy.js to the rescue</h2>

<p>For the video bit, I use <a href="https://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fantimatter15%2Fwhammy&amp;ei=skkQU-qzKa3W7QaYsoGYAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnojPKL3RVts0aijCFcY0QaXSF8A&amp;bvm=bv.61965928,d.ZGU">whammy.js</a> now. It allows to take frames from the canvas and put them together as WebM videos.</p>

<h2>The next steps</h2>

<p>So I can record video - but no audio. That&rsquo;s pretty bad.<br/>
I will also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/streamproc/MediaStreamRecorder">MediaStreamRecorder</a> which should give me access to video and audio recording.</p></article>
