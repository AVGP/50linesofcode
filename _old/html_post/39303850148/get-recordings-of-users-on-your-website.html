<h1>Get recordings of users on your website</h1><p>2012-12-31 13:50:33 GMT</p><article><p>As my latest project, <a href="http://www.neee.ws">Neeews</a>, started the open beta, I wondered how people would use the website.</p>
<p>Despite some concerns about the users privacy, I started using <a href="http://www.mouseflow.com">MouseFlow</a> during the beta stage. MouseFlow records the users mouse movements and keyboard inputs. You can then screen those and find out, if people use the website the way you anticipated, if they misunderstand things or if they just straightly ignore parts of it.</p>
<p>You get 100 recordings per month on the <strong>free plan</strong> but they don&rsquo;t support session-based pages for free, which excludes login-only pages from the recordings (but you can get this on the paid plans).</p>
<p>There is another good alternative: <a href="http://www.ghostrec.com">GhostRec</a>. It offers 100 recordings on the free plan, which also includes login-only pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I use Mouseflow then anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I decided to go with MouseFlow, because <a href="http://mouseflow.com/support/questions/how-will-visitors-privacy-be-affected/"><strong>users can actually opt-out </strong></a><strong><a href="http://mouseflow.com/support/questions/how-will-visitors-privacy-be-affected/">of being recorded</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As the privacy of my visitors and users is really important to me, I highly appreciate this feature and I don&rsquo;t know of a similar option for GhostRec.</p>
<p>On the other hand: The recordings give me a really helpful insight of how users interact with my website. </p>
<p>I think, the opt-out (plus a notice that is displayed when users sign up) is a good trade-off between the two aspects.</p></article>
