<h1>Measuring developer performance is tricky.</h1><p>2012-12-06 15:00:20 GMT</p><article><p>As a manager, you usually want to know, how the performance of your employees is.</p>
<p>You want to know, if you need to give them training, if you need to adjust some misbehaviour or if their productivity is simply bad.</p>
<p>But how would you do that for a developer (especially, when you&rsquo;re not a developer yourself)?</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly difficult thing to do, as there is hardly a good metric to measure the performance without reading their code.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some metrics and their problems:</p>

<p><strong>1. Lines of code</strong></p>
<p>You simply look at how many lines of code the developer created.</p>
<p>This is an obviously bad one for measuring their performance - if a good developer finds an elegant (and still read- and maintainable) solution in just a few lines of code while a not-so-good developer needs pages and pages of code to do the same, the metric will promote the wrong person. That obviously leads to less productivity and possibly less quality.</p>
<p><strong>2. Number of commits</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this one once and I can&rsquo;t stop shaking my head about it.</p>
<p>This metric has nothing to do with the actual work. You can rank good in this metric by simply commiting every single line you changed. It&rsquo;s completely unrelated to the work you actually did. Simple example: Somebody corrects a few typos in a template and commits after every single corrected typo. He may have 40 commits now. Somebody else implemented a big feature in the same time, adding new functionality and lots of potentially tricky code - but he only commits when a block of functionality is done - let&rsquo;s say he committed 10 times during this. According to this &ldquo;metric&rdquo; he is performing worse than the person who just corrected typos without adding much value.</p>
<p><strong>3.Â </strong><strong>Number of user stories / tickets / issues</strong></p>
<p>This one isn&rsquo;t too bad, but still not good. You&rsquo;re measuring the number of things done.</p>
<p>Somebody who resolved 10 tickets is better than somebody, who just resolved 3, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>First of all: Tickets may differ in complexity. A ticket that says: &ldquo;Move the login button from the left to the right&rdquo; is extremly different from &ldquo;Implement a real-time video streaming feature&rdquo;. The first one may take 20 minutes, the other one may take some hours.</p>
<p><strong>Variation: Taking complexity into account</strong></p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d have a solution to that one: You multiply the number of tickets with their complexity. Somebody doing 10 user stories with 1 story point (easy stuff) would then have the same performance as somebody who resolves 1 user story with 10 story points (complex stuff).</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, this is flawed as well.</strong></p>
<p>Implementing something the right way instead of &ldquo;quick &amp; dirty&rdquo; requires additional time. To increase your &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; when this metric is applied, you would usually go for &ldquo;quick &amp; dirty&rdquo; to raise your throughput. That is a horrible thing, because it punishes the developers who do it right. Quick &amp; dirty solutions are piling up as technical debt and ultimately lead to unmaintainable code, that is pricy to fix.</p>
<p><strong>4. Time</strong></p>
<p>Time tracking is another option for measuring how somebody performs. But it has the same problem as the &ldquo;Lines of code&rdquo; metric: A developer that solves a problem in the right way in 20 minutes is punished, while a developer who takes longer is rewarded.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Don&rsquo;t use a naive metric, use communication</strong></p>
<p>There simply is no way of just applying some simple ruleset when you want to evaluate the performance of your developers. So, how do you do it then?</p>
<p>My suggestion is: Listen to the team, listen to people who work with the developers you want to evaluate and listen to the developers as well.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong></p>
<p>Listening to what the team communicates is crucial here.</p>
<p>Is somebody always saying something like &ldquo;I will have to look at this together with X&rdquo; - the person in question may need training.</p>
<p>Is somebody always saying they&rsquo;re working on the same thing, without giving a reason? They may need help to perform better or they may not match the project.</p>
<p>Is the team complaining about somebody being unproductive? You should take action.</p>
<p>Is the team happy and things move forward? Let them go on with it! Don&rsquo;t get in their way.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong></p>
<p>You should also listen to other people, working with the developers. For example the customer support or the product managers.</p>
<p>If they are happy with how the developers handle requests and tasks, you shouldn&rsquo;t be worried about their performance.</p>
<p>If you hear bad things (such as deadlines not being kept etc.), you should investigate this and resolve the issues.</p></article>
