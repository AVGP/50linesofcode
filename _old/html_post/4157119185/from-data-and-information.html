<h1>From data and information</h1><p>2011-03-28 10:40:06 GMT</p><article><p>Its the <a target="_blank" href="http://datalove.me">Summer of Datalove</a>!</p>
<p>That made me think - the topic is very interesting and can be easily misunderstood.</p>

<p>First of all: Its not about post-privacy. Its not about the transparent citizen. Its not about &ldquo;Fuck copyright&rdquo;. At least what I consider the &ldquo;Summer of datalove&rdquo; for myself.</p>

<p>First of all, we need to make sure, that we&rsquo;re using the same terms for the exact same things. Two of them may not be confused:</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Information</strong> so who&rsquo;s who?</p>

<p><strong>Data: </strong>Data basically is something we may communicate, store, create or obtain.</p>
<p>Put on its own, it has no meaning. It might be in any imaginable form, not necessarily digital or numeric. It might be a light beam, some number written on a piece of paper, something you get told or - of course - binary data in some variation.</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> Information is <em>based on</em> data. The information can be spoken word, text, pictures, music, software, video, whatever. Basically information is <em>data put into some context</em>.</p>

<p>So <strong>Information = Data + Context</strong> to put it short.</p>
<p>Lets see an example: 2 3 5 7. This is data. It consists of four numbers.</p>
<p>What does it mean? Impossible to say.</p>
<p>Is it good or bad? Impossible to judge.</p>

<p>It is data but it isn&rsquo;t information - it has no direct meaning. Of course you immediately try to find a context to put some meaning into it. It might be the first four natural prime-numbers, or it might be some PIN-Number. Or part of a telephone-number. Those are all contexts - the data put into some of these contexts (or completely different ones) gives you a certain piece of information.</p>

<p>This is, where things like net-neutrality and datalove join the game.</p>
<p>Data today usually refers to some kind of digital data. Let it be the figures of some company, government statistics or media distributed through the internet.</p>
<p>Even the sensitive information (note: information, not data) is - thanks to Facebook, twitter, foursquare et. al. - mostly present in the digital ecosystem, too.</p>

<p>Data itself may not be considered good or bad. It may not be treated different depending on some imposed context.</p>
<p>Data is produced by information - it is used to store (e.g. be written down or saved in some IT-system) or communicate information.</p>
<p>What the data-love-initiative is proposing is, that the resulting data should be allowed to travel from its source to its destination without having to overcome any obstacles. Data, that is published into the public digital ecosystem should be abled to circulate without facing any barriers - especially not barriers set up by providers of the net-infrastructure.</p>
<p>An example for one of those barriers is the &ldquo;<em>internet-killswitch&rdquo;</em> in Egypt, triggered during the liberation protests or the data-filtering taking place in China.</p>
<p>These barriers are often tried to be legitimated by creating the illusion of &ldquo;bad data&rdquo; - which is stupid.</p>
<p>To give a hard example: Even child-pornographic images are not evil <em>data</em>. They are the same bits as in any other information transferred. Those <em>information </em>of course is illegal and evil and shouldn&rsquo;t even be created. But this has to be taken care of <strong>before</strong> the information is transformed into data, that is transferred in the net.</p>

<p>This point is important: We need to be careful about the <em>information</em>, which is directly originating in the real world. To stick to the example: We need to protect children from pedophiles, we need to hunt them down! Just filtering out the data isn&rsquo;t a solution at all and may create unpleasant side-effects.</p>

<p>Another point is the privacy, which is a very important thing.</p>
<p>The privacy-issues are also originating before the data starts circulating:</p>
<p>We need to be careful, what information we share with whom - and how.</p>
<p>If you use payback-program-cards of any kind, you create data containing the information &ldquo;who bought what when and where?&rdquo; - this data is then out of your control. The payback-program-provider has this data and can do whatever he wants with it. You don&rsquo;t even know the nature of this data - what is stored? How long? Where is it stored? How is it processed? Who has access to it? All these questions cannot be answered. But its not the data that makes the problem - its the fact, that you gave information to someone else. If you trust this someone: Good. If not: Bad.</p>
<p>To make this a bit more clear here: Lets say, you have a conversation with one of your closer friends. You are telling him, you bought a specific product yesterday at a certain store to a given price.</p>
<p>So you shared this information as spoken data with someone you trust.</p>
<p>He might use this data to find out, that he bought the same product at another store yesterday - but for a lower price. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you can bring the thing back to the store you got it from and buy it again at the store your friend recommended and save some money this way. The information was used in a good way for you!</p>
<p>Lets take the same situation in a small variation: You gave <strong>the exact same data</strong><em> (bouth what when where for how much) </em>to some marketing-company you better hadn&rsquo;t trusted. They use it for profiling and sending you unwanted advertising-material. In this case the information was used in a bad way for you. </p>

<p>You see: The information can be used in a good or a bad way, making it either good or evil - the data is the same in both cases, so judging by just looking at the data is nonsense.</p>

<p>I hope this cleared things up a bit and made the distinction between data and information in the context of net-neutrality, datalove and privacy a bit easier.</p></article>
