<h1>Voodoo-Solutions</h1><p>2011-02-16 04:26:00 GMT</p><article><p>Today I wanna introduce the term &ldquo;Voodoo-Solution&rdquo; to the public.</p>
<p>Certainly you know this kind of solution to a specific problem*.</p>
<p>Nowadays, if you run into a problem and can&rsquo;t solve it on your own in a reasonable amount of time, you search the web for a solution. To get this right: The web is just enlarging the scope of this phenomenon - it exists since people talk about problems and their solutions, I believe.</p>
<p>When crawling through the search results, you may find a vast amount of different solutions - and some of them are what I refer to as <strong><em>Voodoo-Solutions</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What renders these solutions special is the fact, that they include unrelated-seeming steps (often <em>lots</em> of these) and only work for a small group of people - and what is the most interesting fact: If you re-enact them with some changes, they still work. Its also possible, that re-enacting them the <em>exact same way</em> may not work <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, <strong>Vodoo-Solutions</strong> are based upon the desperate, strenuous efforts to solve the problem. In this process one may reach the <em>point of Voodoo.</em> The one in need of the problem will <em>try any possible and <strong>impossible </strong></em>way to get to a solution.</p>
<p>This leads to a tremendous amount of steps to be taken to get it done. Usually, once a working solution is found, the wish and will to strap down the solution to the necessary steps is close to zero - and here we are: The birth of a <em><strong>Voodoo-Solution</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A Voodoo-Solution might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get it working, just unplug the device, uninstall all the drivers, then load up your browser and delete the cache and the cookies. Then uninstall the device&rsquo;s software. Afterwards restart the computer and wait a few minutes. Now plug in the device, let the driver-dialog stay open but don&rsquo;t install the drivers yet. First install the device-software. Then install the drivers, unplug and re-plug the device again, restart the computer - and you&rsquo;re done!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing about Voodoo-Solutions is: <strong>Sometimes</strong>, even when including several unrelated-seeming steps, <strong>they are the way to go</strong> and get things to work properly.</p>
<p>I think its best, to stay easy with these things and keep a smile. For example, I refer to this kind of solution with sentences like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You need to wait for the next moon-eclipse, then eat some strawberry-jam on midnight, then start the process while jumping from left to right and vice versa, while having your feet strapped together with some duct-tape. That&rsquo;ll work!&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So long folks, hope you enjoyed this little post and remember it when you come across the next <em>Voodoo-Solution</em>. ;)</p>
<p>*) Especially, when you&rsquo;ve been fiddling with Bluetooth or Java - or worse: Both in combination!</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: </strong>To get this clear - I&rsquo;m not ranting about people posting what I consider &ldquo;Voodoo-Solutions&rdquo;! Better a Voodoo-Solution than no solution at all! And of course: I am posting this kind of solution from time to time, too, when the problem gives me no other possibility or I am just too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to strap the solution down to the bare necessities.</p></article>
