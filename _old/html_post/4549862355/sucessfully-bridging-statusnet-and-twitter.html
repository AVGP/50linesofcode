<h1>Sucessfully bridging StatusNet and Twitter</h1><p>2011-04-12 10:00:06 GMT</p><article><p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>
<p>Some weeks ago, I <a target="_blank" href="http://houston.geekonaut.de">set up a local</a> <a href="http://status.net/open-source">StatusNet</a> server on my server.</p>
<p>StatusNet is an open-source, decentralized microblogging-platform like Twitter.</p>
<p>But you can host it on your own system, or just join a running one (for example the famous <a href="http://www.identi.ca">identi.ca</a>). The nice thing is: Whatever server you are registered to, you have the possibility to subscribe (which is the StatusNet equivalent of &ldquo;following&rdquo;) to any user on any server. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if that user is on the same server or on any other, as long as its StatusNet.</p>
<p>This idea seemed shiny to me: I do not need to rely on <em>one </em>single point of failure (which we all know as the &ldquo;failwhale&rdquo;) - if some server goes down, only the users registered there are affected. And if I want to make sure, I&rsquo;m having the service available - I can host it on my own which makes <em>me</em> the one being responsible for the service available of my own account.</p>
<p>If some server may go down, a part of my subscribed users may not be able to update their status - but all the others not on that particular server still are.</p>
<p>Thus, the whole infrastructure is more reliable in general.</p>
<p>As I host my own StatusNet-Server (<a href="http://houston.geekonaut.de">here</a>, to mention again) I ran into a small issue, that took me some time and <a href="http://forum.status.net/discussion/1491/twitterbridge-only-imports-tweets-but-cannot-post-notices-to-twitter-solved">help</a> from the IRC and the forum to get it fixed.</p>
<p>This post should be a help for anyone encountering this&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The reality</strong></p>
<p>But here comes the twist: Many of the people, I&rsquo;m interested in having status updates from <em>aren&rsquo;t on any statusnet-server</em>.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on twitter, mostly. And not only do I want to keep up with their updates - no! I also want to keep them up to date with my own updates.</p>
<p>Both of this should be possible without having to check&amp;post on twitter and statusnet simultaneously - here comes the nice thing: <strong><em>It is.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>StatusNet ships with a Twitter-Bridge. You can import the twitter-timeline and you can make the system post your updates to twitter automatically. This was exactly, what I was looking for. I can use StatusNet, have people from other StatusNet-Servers subscribed directly, benefiting from the decentralized, open infrastructure and have the well-known functionality of twitter <em>inside,</em> without having the double effort.</p>
<p>So I configured it to do its task.</p>
<p>This is pretty easy. Just follow the README for that (situated in plugins/TwitterBridge/README) - et voilá - it imported my timeline like a cake.</p>
<p>Pretty! But trying to post to twitter from houston did not work!</p>
<p>To fix this, turn of the <em>queuedaemon</em>. and start daemons again. This fixed the issue for me.</p></article>
