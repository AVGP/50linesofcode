<h1>Sexism on conferences</h1><p>2012-11-26 14:00:22 GMT</p><article><p>To admit this: I have been sexist on my own by just not realizing that I was.</p>
<p>Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, I learnt to see the mistakes I made in the past - thanks to her!</p>
<p>Tech conferences are still struggling to get out of their sexist &ldquo;boys only&rdquo; image.</p>

<p>I guess the only real way around this is doing blind reviews on call-for-papers to make sure no discrimination can happen. But I guess, thanks to the image of the tech-conference scene, the problem kicks in earlier at the moment: There are too few women applying for being a speaker. In that case: <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Women_speakers#Solutions">Read this wonderful article.</a></p>

<p>An idea that I don&rsquo;t find helpful (in fact, I think it&rsquo;s sexist) is offering discount on tickets for women. Why should that help?</p>
<p>Because women can&rsquo;t afford the tickets, because they&rsquo;re female?</p>
<p><strong>No. </strong></p>
<p>Do they need additional incentive, because they&rsquo;re just not so interested in tech?</p>
<p><strong>Hell, no!</strong></p>
<p>I think the only ways of making the conferences more appealing are:</p>
<ul><li>Clearly communicate, that discrimination, sexism and harassment will be prosecuted</li>
<li>Have a code of conduct, that includes penalties for misbehaviour</li>
<li>Have people, who make sure, the code of conduct is followed and who actively and passively enforce the proper behaviour of every attendee.</li>
</ul><p>I guess these may be good steps forward re-shaping the conference culture to get sexism, harassment and discrimination out of the tech scene.</p></article>
