<h1>Ignite talks coming to Zurich!</h1><p>2014-04-02 09:27:00 GMT</p><article><h2>So what&rsquo;s an ignite talk?</h2>

<p>Quoting from <a href="http://www.igniteshow.com/howto">the ignite show website</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Imagine that you’re in front of an audience made up of your friends, family, and people from your community, about to present a 5-minute talk on the thing you’re most passionate about.  
You’ve brought 20 slides, which advance every 15 seconds whether you’re ready or not.   
You have a few last-minute butterflies, but off you go—and the crowd loves it. Welcome to Ignite.
</code></pre>

<p>Others have explained it, too: <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2009/how-to-give-a-great-ignite-talk/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/08/while-i-was-in-portland-oregon-last-month-i-kept-meeting-people-who-raved-about-ignite-whats-ignite-id-say-kind-of-like.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>While ignite started as a geek event, I found it to be a great way to share experiences and ideas with a diverse audience - any topic is welcome and the format makes you distill the juicy bits together and helps you to avoid getting sidetracked into tricky details.</p>

<h2>Getting started with ignite talks in Zurich</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://igniteshow.com/cities/all">Ignite groups and events all over the world</a> now it&rsquo;s time Zurich gets a chance to spread ideas and inspire, too.</p>

<p>This is why I just created the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ignite-Zurich/">Ignite Zurich community</a> to open up this opportunity to people in and around Zurich - it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you ever did an ignite talk - or any public speaking at all - before or if public speaking is part of your daily business.</p>

<p>I will do my best to <em>make the community a space to explore, experiment and exchange</em> using the ignite method.</p>

<h2>Like the idea?</h2>

<p>If you like what you just read, I invite you to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ignite-Zurich/">join the community</a> and give it a go at our meetups.</p></article>
