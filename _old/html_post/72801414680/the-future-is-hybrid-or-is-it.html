<h1>The future is hybrid... or is it?</h1><p>2014-01-09 22:03:02 GMT</p><article><p>After my talk at Future of web apps in October 2013 in London, I got interviewed by Louise from Future Insights about the future of mobile apps and why I was talking about hybrid apps.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.futureinsights.com/home/firefox-os-and-the-future-of-hybrid-apps.html">the article here</a> - but I can&rsquo;t stress enough, that <em>hybrid isn&rsquo;t the future, it&rsquo;s a vehicle</em>. A vehicle for the mobile web apps.</p>

<p>Right now we have to cut a few corners to deliver the best user experience on mobile with web technologies. Many users are still bound to the marketplaces (where Mozilla&rsquo;s approach of &ldquo;installing the web&rdquo; is having the potential to change the game) and many device features are still only released as APIs for native applications.</p>

<p>To unlock these two, often business-relevant, features you have to either <a href="http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/11/web-designers-phonegap.html">go hybrid</a> in <a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/17/best-of-both-worlds-mixing-html5-native-code/">some</a> way or you go native.</p>

<p>Native, however, locks you in whereas hybrid only does to a certain degree (depending on the strategy you chose).</p>

<p>So, for now, I think some sort of hybrid approach is the vehicle to help us move the app makers into the web universe and work all together towards an even-more competitive web platform.</p></article>
