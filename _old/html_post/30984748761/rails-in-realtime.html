<p><a href="http://layervault.com">LayerVault</a> is built using the popular web framework, Ruby on Rails. The framework, at times known for its divisiveness, has <a href="http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/18131971518/no-one-said-scaling-was-easy">allowed LayerVault to grow from a single box to a swarm of machines over the past year.</a> Recently, there has been a wave of great JavaScript-based frameworks that make creating a “realtime” app a cinch. Because LayerVault is a perfect facsimile of a team’s filesystem, having the web interface update immediately is incredibly important. Every ⌘R is two key presses too many. Finder doesn’t require you to refresh every time a file changes, why should a web app? We’re happy with Rails, so transitioning to Meteor, Ember.js or Backbone.js whole hog isn’t the right move for us.</p>
<p>The phrase “realtime” is thrown around about as much as “local” and “disruptive” these days, so the phrase is often ambiguous. For the purposes of this post, a “realtime” app is the following: page refreshes are not required to see the most up-to-date state of information and new information is communicated in tens of milliseconds instead of hundreds or thousands.</p>
<p>This blog post will cover some of the patterns that we use to allow LayerVault customers to never worry about pressing ⌘R. This is all done by using vanilla <code>*.html.erb</code> templates and never rendering any parts of the page using JavaScript. Once a database record is changed, that change appears in &lt;500ms in a customer’s browser.</p>
