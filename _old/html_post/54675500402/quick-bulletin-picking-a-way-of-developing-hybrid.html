<h1>Quick bulletin: Picking a way of developing hybrid mobile apps</h1><p>2013-07-05 15:13:00 GMT</p><article><p>Due to popular demand: A superquick guide to picking the right tools for you.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: You may want to give my <a href="http://avgp.github.io/hybrid-strategy-picker/">Hybrid Strategy Picker</a> a whirl. Be careful tho, it&rsquo;s far too simplistic, but a good starting point.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This is by no means complete and it may not turn out to be the right fit for you. For more details and the full story <a href="http://avgp.github.io/hybrid-strategies-pick/">see my slides from SpainJS 2013</a>.</p>

<p>With this out of the way, let&rsquo;s step into this!</p>

<h2>So you want to go hybrid..</h2>

<p>..nice! But before you start looking at the technologies, you need to answer a couple of questions and make a couple of decisions.</p>

<p><strong>This post aims at speeding this up a little for you</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Remark</strong> The following choices can be considered <strong>production ready</strong>.</p>

<h2>Choice 1: Only Javascript</h2>

<p>If you come from a JS world and have been working with the backend side of things a lot and you feel more comfortable with <strong>writing pure Javascript all the time</strong> (or Coffeescript, for that matter), this choice is for you.</p>

<p>You should have a close look at <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch-bundle/">Sencha</a> as it gives you a one-stop-solution: UI, Logic / Architecture, Packaging right out of the box.</p>

<h2>Choice 2: HTML / CSS / JS</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re coming from the web world and know all parts of the frontend stack? That gives you a couple of choices on it&rsquo;s own:</p>

<h3>Option A: Kendo + Cordova</h3>

<p>This gives you the UI &amp; Logical architecture from Kendo (MVVM) and deployability to a range of platforms, including iOS and Android.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s even a simple way of getting into it right from your browser, check <a href="http://icenium.com">Icenium</a> to get up and running in no time.</p>

<h3>Option B: LAB + Cordova</h3>

<p>This gives you the wonderful world of Angular.js with the UI sweetness &amp; easy prototyping Lungo.js provides.
Check out <a href="https://github.com/centralway/lungo-angular-bridge">our Github repository</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/centralway/grunt-init-lungo-angular">grunt-init task for the LAB</a> to get started as quick as possible.</p>

<p>I hope you now have some pointers to go and play with things that are ready for prime time - use these powers with care and never forget</p>
