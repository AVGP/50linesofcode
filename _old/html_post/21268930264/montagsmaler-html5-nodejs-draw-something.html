<h1>Montagsmaler - HTML5 / node.js "Draw something" clone</h1><p>2012-04-17 14:54:21 GMT</p><article><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the flash-based &ldquo;Draw my thing&rdquo; and built my own version with node.js, HTML5 an socket.io and deployed it on <a href="http://www.nodester.com/">nodester</a>. Its <a href="https://github.com/AVGP/Montagsmaler" title="Montagsmaler on GitHub" target="_blank">open source</a>. You can play it <a href="http://montagsmaler.nodester.com" target="_blank">here</a> or on <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/fbmontagsmaler">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>It works on modern browsers and I tested it with Android Opera Mini and the Android browser, too.</p>
<p>Here is the whole story:</p>

<p><strong>First, I got pissed off&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Some weeks ago I came across <a href="http://www.omgpop.com/games/drawmything" target="_blank">&ldquo;Draw my thing&rdquo;</a> (via the app version &ldquo;Draw something&rdquo;). I like it and my girlfriend and I wanted to play it together. When I was on my phone and she was on her laptop, we wanted to start. &ldquo;Its the same game vendor (OMGPop) and its the same thing. Should work, I guess&rdquo; way my initial thought. It didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Draw something&rdquo; and &ldquo;Draw my thing&rdquo; - while being named similarily and utilizing the same game principle, it was not possible to play together using both versions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meh, okay - I just get my laptop and use that.&rdquo;, I continued. Nevertheless, being flash-based it was pretty slow on my laptop (which is now 4 years old&hellip;) and even when trying to play together it was a bad user experience (&ldquo;Okay, now I&rsquo;ll send you this game&rsquo;s link via google talk and then you open it in your browser&rdquo; &ldquo;But I am already on OMGpop in the &quot;Draw my thing&rdquo; screen. Can&rsquo;t I just get a notification or something?&ldquo;&hellip; and it never really worked to play this game together.</p>
<p>So I rebuild it with HTML5, node.js and socket.io</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, that can&rsquo;t be THAT hard!&rdquo; went through my head. And so I started.</p>
<p>I used an HTML5 canvas element, <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> and node.js for the whole thing.</p>
<p>When the first player connects, she sees &ldquo;Waiting for other player&rdquo; until a second player connects. The two then get in the game, they can save and share their drawings and the game ends, when one of the players disconnect.</p>
<p>My experience</p>
<p>It was all so easy and works like a charm. It even works on my Android phone - I just had to write a little wrapper for touch-events.</p>
<p>The server code is 119 lines Javascript (node.js / socket.io), the client-logic is 195 lines javascript and a bit HTML / CSS.</p>
<p>I made this open-source, you can <a href="https://github.com/AVGP/Montagsmaler" target="_blank">find it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The deployment with <a href="http://www.nodester.com">nodester</a> was simple, easy and awesome.</p></article>
