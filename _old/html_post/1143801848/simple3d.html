<h1>Simple3D</h1><p>2010-09-18 15:57:00 GMT</p><article><p>So, the code is <a title="Simple3D at GitHub" href="http://github.com/AVGP/Simple3D">public</a> and its time to tell you about the project.</p>
<p>Its something pure educational. Mostly for my own education, but I think some of you may be interested in this and use it for their own experiments.</p>
<p>If you want to, feel free! Just fork it and play.</p>
<p>Nomen est omen. Simple3D is a very, <em>very</em>, <em><strong>very</strong></em> simple 3D engine.</p>
<p>Its goal is not performance, but clean, structured and portable code and my goal with this is just my own education.</p>
<p>With this project, I wanted to use my knowledge of computer-graphics theory to build a real thing. I decided I would like to go from a pretty low level.</p>
<p>This is the reason, the library can easily been ported to everything, that is abled to draw some sort of pixels. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>There is plenty of work in this and as this is a freetime-project, I&rsquo;ll only work on this whenever there is time for it. Change frequency may vary between minutes and years, probably.</p>
<p>However to me this is an interesting project. I learnt alot already and I am sure there is much more to learn from it.</p>
<p>Currently the engine allows the following:</p>
<ul><li>Create a window for drawing</li>
<li>Creating different entities (some of them aren&rsquo;t up to date with the new version. These are S3DCube, S3DRect and S3DTetraeder. I&rsquo;ll get on this soon)</li>
<li>Primitives S3DPoint, S3DLine, S3DTriangle and S3DMesh</li>
<li>S3DMesh allows you to load a complex entity, consisting of different colored triangles, from a file.</li>
<li>Rotating, scaling and moving entities.</li>
<li>Rendering your entities on screen, of course :D</li>
</ul><p>I concentrated the platform-specific code (i.e. X11-related code) in as few places as possible, thus its not a hard job to port it to other systems.</p>
<p>However, as I am currently trying to get some features into it, there is really much room for optimization. And its lightyears away from a &ldquo;state-of-the-art&rdquo; engine, of course! So if you&rsquo;re just looking around for a good 3D engine you could use one of the dozens of other engines for productive use. This thing really is for educational purpose ;)</p>
<p>But if you wonder, how 3D graphics can be done - Simple3D is the right thing for you, maybe. Its well documented (I&rsquo;ll improve this further.) yet but you still need some theoretical knowledge to understand the code.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like the idea of sharing knowledge, so here you go.</p>
<p>Its licenced using the MIT licence, so you&rsquo;re pretty free with it - but I&rsquo;d welcome it, if you give me feedback on what you do with it, okay? Thanks.</p>
<p>Have fun with it :)</p>
<p>So long and thanks for all the fish!</p></article>
