<h1>User testing done right</h1><p>2013-05-07 14:00:21 GMT</p><article><p>Don&rsquo;t make assumptions about the user, have her test your website or app! It&rsquo;s easy, quickly done and cheap. Trust me.</p>

<p>When it comes to usability and providing the best solution for the user, I have seen lots of mind-numbing, long and - in the end - pointless discussions.</p>

<p>People tend to project their own behaviour onto the users of their application - and often this turns into discussions about the user as if she was an alien, yet to be discovered life form from outer space.</p>

<p>I did that as well, but I learnt my lesson: <strong>I&rsquo;m not the user. You&rsquo;re not the user user either.</strong></p>

<p>You know how your application is supposed to work. You know what feature can be found where - your users may think differently. And they may be different from what you think they are.</p>

<p>A brilliant example was one of my websites: I put a big, prominent &ldquo;Sign in with twitter&rdquo; button on the homepage, but the conversion rate was poor. So I decided to do a very simple, quick and cheap way of usability testing:</p>

<p><strong>The 5 second test</strong></p>

<p>In this case, you take a screenshot of a prototype, your website, your app, your design and upload it to <a href="http://www.fivesecondtest.com/">Usability Hub</a> (which is free, when you do other peoples tests - or you can pay for answers) and asked the question &ldquo;where can you become a user of that service&rdquo; and asked for 10 answers.</p>

<p>Now this picture is shown to different participants for 5 seconds each. Afterwards my question will appear and they can answer.
The answers were surprising and shocking: Only 2 people got it right.
The others answered along the lines &ldquo;I see, where I can sign in after sign up, but where do I sign up?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This was interesting, because with Twitter login, there are no concepts such as &ldquo;sign up&rdquo; and &ldquo;login&rdquo; - you hit &ldquo;sign in&rdquo; the first time and get signed up, you hit it the next time you&rsquo;re on the website and you get logged in.</p>

<p>Knowing the struggles of my users, I re-captioned the button &ldquo;Sign up with twitter&rdquo; and added a little &ldquo;Sign in with twitter&rdquo; on the top right corner et voila: Conversion rate rocketed.</p>

<p>UsabilityHub also offers other tests, like</p>

<p><strong>The click test</strong>, where you ask your users a question like &ldquo;Where would you click to sign up&rdquo; and see a) where they actually click b) how long it takes them to spot it.</p>

<p><strong>The nav flow test</strong>, where you upload multiple screens and ask the user to carry out a task that should take them from one screen to another - you&rsquo;ll learn if your navigation concept works from this test type.</p>

<p><strong>Test early &amp; test often</strong></p>

<p>This shows: Testing early is possible and valuable! All it takes is a few minutes and a screenshot, a design, or even a picture of a sketch on paper.
This allows you to check, if your users &ldquo;get it&rdquo; on the many different levels:</p>

<ul><li>Does the wording make sense?</li>
<li>Does the layout structure and content hiearchy make sense?</li>
<li>Is the visual design confusing people?</li>
</ul><p>For all this, you don&rsquo;t need a working prototype, you need nothing &ldquo;done&rdquo; or &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; - but you can already learn about your users. It takes minutes and is cheap (or free).</p>

<p><strong>User tests</strong></p>

<p>With services such as <a href="http://ox86.tumblr.com/post/39297092190/betapunch-test-your-website-with-real-users">BetaPunch</a> or <a href="http://www.youeye.com">YouEye</a> it&rsquo;s very easy to get real users to do a couple of tasks on your app or website and get a recording with them saying what they think while carrying out the tasks you gave them as well as their inputs and mouse movements.</p>

<p>BetaPunch, for example, offers one free test to get you started.</p>

<p>There is also a user test <em>light</em> version, where you can only get recordings of your website / app users using your app and see their mouse movements and inputs - <a href="http://ox86.tumblr.com/post/39303850148/get-recordings-of-users-on-your-website">see here for more details on that</a>.</p></article>
