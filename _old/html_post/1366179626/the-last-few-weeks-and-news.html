<h1>The last few weeks and news!</h1><p>2010-10-21 13:54:00 GMT</p><article><p>Sorry for the inactivity throughout the last week(s) - its been a busy time!</p>
<p>The studies started again, I went to the Qt Developer Days 2010 (which was a great thing and a great time!), work started again and I&rsquo;ve been developing on some thing.</p>
<p>Here is what:</p>
<p>I have been using KDE for years now, stuck with KDE 3 though. Upgrading to KDE 4 basically brought discontent. The system was unstable, workflough was tenacious and I did not really like it.</p>
<p>I do not like Gnome for some reasons. It feels like working in a patched together environment and this was my reason to ask: Why not build your own?</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I first asked myself what I expect from my desired desktop environment. This lead to a bunch of interesting points:</p>
<ol><li>It should not drag a ton of dependencies with it</li>
<li>It should not need too many resources - speaking of disk space, memory and screen-space.</li>
<li>I should be abled to customize to look and feel like I wish it to.</li>
<li>It should allow me to prevent, what I call &ldquo;window war&rdquo; (i.e. unhandy working with lots of windows)</li>
<li>It should allow me to use it in a fast and comfortable manner.</li>
<li>It should be reliable and stable.</li>
</ol><p>Thinking of this lead to the following essence:</p>
<ul><li>Having a set of less-or-more independent applications as a desktop, tray, etc.</li>
<li>Getting away from the unhandy start-menu to having a &ldquo;Starter&rdquo;, which is a window showing the apps for example in categories, having access to the apps without hangling through menus, submenus, subsubmenus, etc.</li>
<li>Making it possible to use the keyboard to switch through workspaces</li>
<li>Grouping windows together, independent from the underlying applications</li>
<li>Saving space on the screen by using minimal window decorations and having a shortcut to tile all visible windows to have a possibility to switch between them easily and fast.</li>
<li>Using a simple, yet fancy widget toolkit.</li>
<li>Implementing a kind of watchdog for the running environmental processes to restart them automatically on crash.</li>
</ul><p>So I started implementing it.</p>
<p>It took me some time to set things up and get a basic version working.</p>
<p>Right now I have the foundation for accomplishing the given tasks. Yet it consists of a set of very VERY basic applications for tray, starter and desktop. It contains a basic window manager. So right now, none of the fancy features specified is present, but I&rsquo;ll go for them now.</p>
<p>As usual, the project can be found on GitHub and you&rsquo;re invited to fork and build whatever you like on it. I&rsquo;d appreciate any work - let it be in the core system or on additional applications. For example you can build a fully-featured desktop or a tricky, feature-rich tray. You might, as well, port it to any widget toolkit you like!</p>
