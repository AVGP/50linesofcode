<h1>Why auphonics is nice when you are podcasting</h1><p>2012-06-04 11:47:00 GMT</p><article><p>I recently started <a href="http://codecast.geekonaut.de" target="_blank">a podcast</a> (in German) and was overwhelmed by the resonance I got for it.</p>
<p>My first experience with podcasting was: Audacity crashed a few times randomly and recording podcasts with it was not really enjoyable. I ditched it and recorded it with a simpler audiorecorder. </p>
<p>That, in turn, made it an extra step to normalize and denoise the sound file. I decided to leave out those post-production steps. But listeners noticed a low volume and some noise in the recording then.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/smnkrl">@smnkrl</a> pointed me to <a href="https://auphonic.com/">Auphonic</a>. It allows to upload a bunch of audio formats and does denoise and normalization automatically, if you wish it to.</p>
<p>It offers even more than just that (which is the baseline for me):</p>
<ul><li>Upload of cover image</li>
<li>Splitting on chapters and chapter marks</li>
<li>Choose the output format and bitrate</li>
<li>Filtering and adaptive leveling</li>
<li>Upload to SFTP, FTP or Dropbox after production.</li>
</ul><p>And it&rsquo;s <strong>all free</strong>.</p>

<p>To me the service seems to be pretty reliable and works perfect. This way, podcast production works like a charm for me.</p></article>
