<h1>Quick review: Samsung 11" Chromebook</h1><p>2013-10-29 12:00:00 GMT</p><article><h2>The first impression in short (TL;DR)</h2>

<p>The Samsung 11&quot; Chromebook is a solid, cheap and lightweight device to get work done while being on the go.</p>

<h2>How it all came to be</h2>

<p>I work alot while I&rsquo;m on the road - be it commuting on the bus or travelling around on a train or airplane.</p>

<p>During these times I am usually programming (mostly using lightweight or browser-based tools), writing blog posts (like this one) or preparing a slide deck.</p>

<p>I was still searching for a cheap, slightly smaller and lighter device to do those rather simple tasks and when I travelled to London, I decided to go into a store and get my hands on the 11&quot; Chromebooks from HP and Samsung. 
Surprisingly the Samsung one convinced me more with its overall impression - so I bought one - and herein I give you an overview of my experience with it, sitting in an airplane heading home.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>After unwrapping it and plugging in the charger, I was suprised that it was fully uncharged but claimed to be fully charged within the next 40 minutes. And it was!</p>

<p>That initial plus was overthrown by the setup, that needed a WiFi connection but had trouble working with the &ldquo;Sign-In&rdquo; of the wireless network at London Heathrow, so I had trouble setting it up, but the guest mode allowed me to properly surf the net instantly.</p>

<p>The next minor quirk was the initial tour application not responding to my inputs at all - but I can live with that.</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s an app for that!</h2>

<p>I believe in the web as being a powerful platform, so I was looking forward to trying out the many apps from the Chrome Web Store.</p>

<p>I was looking for a decent Markdown editor with a live preview feature, as that&rsquo;s the way I enjoy writing my blog posts the most - and I found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poe-markdown-editor/mpghdlgejmakmgbigejnjnmgdjaddhje">Poe</a>. As my IDE of choice, I picked Cloud9 and after a couple of minutes I was ready to go.</p>

<p>My biggest worry was, that the apps may not work without an internet connection, but flying back just now while writing this post proves that it indeed did work offline.</p>

<p>The great thing: I&rsquo;m not missing any application and if I ever will, I could write that app using my beloved stack of web technologies;</p>

<h2>How working on the Chromebook feels</h2>

<h3>The keyboard</h3>

<p>The keyboard feels good and has decent spacing, sizing and feedback, the only thing that I may miss is the backlight I am used to on my Macbook.</p>

<h3>The screen</h3>

<p>The 11&quot; screen is the perfect size for me, providing enough screen space to work and being comfortably sized for carrying it around.
 The brightness and view angle are sufficient - even this writing session along with my experients, for a bit over 2 hours now, aren&rsquo;t a problem.</p>

<h3>The rest</h3>

<p>The case seems pretty sturdy but definitely has a plastic touch to it, the camera is pretty good and the Chromebook starts up in a couple of seconds and the battery - according to the system panel, should last for around 6 hours, maybe 5 with WiFi turned on.</p>

<p>Only the WiFi gave the impression to have a tendency to be a bit flaky at times.</p></article>
