<h1>Did you know? Screencasting with QuickTimePlayer on OSX</h1><p>2012-09-18 12:57:23 GMT</p><article><p>By pure luck I found that the Quick Time Player on Mac OSX is capable of recording your screen. And to my surprise it allows you to do it in a quite comfortable way.</p>
<p>First of all, you need to click on &ldquo;File&rdquo; and &ldquo;New screen capture&rdquo;. Or you can press CTRL+CMD+N.<img height="252" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZnyS6.png" width="499"/></p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll be asked to select a region of the screen or click to record full screen. If you have multiple screens, this will appear on each of your screens so you can select the (or the region of the) screen to capture.</p>
<p>It will produces a high-quality but large MOV file without audio.</p>
<p>I suggest to use a tool like <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> to convert it to a lower size format and mix in an audio file.</p></article>
