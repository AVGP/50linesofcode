<p>Yeah, a few of us were brainstorming starting one for the group of us in this tumblr CS circuit that would use it in situations where conversing via reblog is a pain in the ass.<br/>Right now it’s just myself, eccentric-nucleus, foldingcookie, and c1QfXUgcGY0.<br/><br/>Server: irc.synirc.net/6667<br/>Channel: #tumblcode</p>
<p>Addendum: I’m tagging everyone who might be interested.</p>
