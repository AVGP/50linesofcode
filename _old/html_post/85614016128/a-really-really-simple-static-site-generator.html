<h1>A really, really simple static site generator</h1><p>2014-05-13 11:00:00 GMT</p><article><p>When I asked for suggestions what <strong>simple</strong> tool I should use to generate static HTML pages from Markdown files, the answer I got mismatched in the definition of simple - and that mad me sad.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: All the static site generators I found are pretty heavy in terms of dependencies and ship with a lot of things I don&rsquo;t need, so I created <a href="https://github.com/avgp/susi">Susi</a> - a really simple, 67 lines node.js based site generator. Give it a go if you want something <strong>truly simple</strong>.</p>

<h2>A simple job</h2>

<p>I wanted to get a super stupidly simple job done quickly:</p>

<p>Compiling a few markdown files into HTML, using a shared HTML skeleton around it.</p>

<h2>Static Site Generators</h2>

<p>That is exactly the domain of static site generators - but there&rsquo;s <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">a ton of them</a> - and even the <a href="http://staticgen.com/">&ldquo;Top list&rdquo;</a> counts a whopping 26 of them.</p>

<p>And all of them appear to come with <strong>lots of stuff I don&rsquo;t need at all</strong>, such as:</p>

<ul><li>Templating languages such as ERB, Jade or Handlebars</li>
<li>Preprocessors like Coffeescript, Sass, Less or Compass</li>
<li>Build tools like Grunt or Gulp</li>
</ul><p>which is fine, if you need some more complex stuff - <strong>but I just want to parse some Markdown into HTML and put a static template around that</strong>.</p>

<h2>Susi, oh Susi&hellip;</h2>

<p>So I got fed up with all those feature-laden tools and decided to figure out what is really essential: <strong>Parsing markdown into HTML and putting it in a template</strong> - the result is <a href="https://github.com/avgp/susi">SuSi</a>.</p>

<p>I used it to revamp the content on <a href="http://www.geekonaut.de">my website</a> and it <strong>only has two dependencies</strong> which are Node.js (because it&rsquo;s a node.js tool) and <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">Marked</a> to parse the markdown files.</p>

<p>The whole <a href="https://github.com/AVGP/susi/blob/master/susi">source code</a> counts <strong>61 lines</strong>. That&rsquo;s pretty small and simple.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s is how a tiny demo:
