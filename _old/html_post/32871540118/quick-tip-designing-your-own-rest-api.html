<h1>Quick tip: Designing your own REST API</h1><p>2012-10-04 13:59:24 GMT</p><article><p>If you want to set up a REST API for your project, you will quickly see a lot of questions arise, especially if you&rsquo;ve been working with a few different APIs yourself.</p>

<ul><li>Should URLs use plural or singular?</li>
<li>How to deal with clients that can&rsquo;t do real REST (e.g. IE 8 Javascript has issues with cross-origin HTTP-PUT and DELETE)?</li>
<li>How should URLs look like? Should they have verbs inside?</li>
<li>How to version the API?</li>
<li>And a lot more.</li>
</ul><p>The answer to some of these questions is: Whatever you like better.</p>
<p>But I have been looking around for some advice from people who are focused on API stuff day in day out.</p>
<p>Now I want to share my findings with you:</p>

<p><strong>Apigee</strong></p>
<p>Apigee is a company that helps you run your API, so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with performance, rate limiting, etc.</p>
<p>They have quite a high-line profile of customers: AT&amp;T, ComCast, Gamespy, Getty Images, ebay, Dell, Swift, Moneybookers and a bunch of other well-known names.</p>
<p>The interesting thing: <strong>They have a blog and a free e-book</strong> about API Design<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.apigee.com/taglist/rest_api_design?page=3">The Blog posts</a> have been collected and put together as a <a href="http://apigee.com/about/content/web-api-design">free e-book</a> and they have <a href="http://apigee.com/about/api-best-practices/all/ebook">some more</a> available for purchase or download.</p>

<p><strong>API Craft Google Group</strong></p>
<p>The other useful thing I stumbled upon is the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft Group</a> where a lot of people actively discuss API design questions, do&rsquo;s&amp;don'ts and it is really insightful to read the discussions.</p></article>
