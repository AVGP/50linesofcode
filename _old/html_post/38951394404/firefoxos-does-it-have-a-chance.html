<h1>FirefoxOS: Does it have a chance?</h1><p>2012-12-27 15:00:29 GMT</p><article><p>After reading Sebastian Anthonys article about why <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/133159-firefox-os-doesnt-stand-a-chance">Firefox OS does not have a chance</a> in the mobile market, I&rsquo;d like to give my opinion.</p>
<p>First of all: The article says, that even if Firefox OS would gain interest and market acceptance for making web applications run like native applications on mobile devices, others like Android or iOS could just do the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any problem. In fact, that would be great.</p>
<p>Firefox OS is <strong>not just an operating system</strong>, it is a <em><strong>philosophy.</strong></em></p>
<p>The web is a powerful and fast-progressing platform and has already started to take the world of software and services by storm.</p>
<p>As the web advances further from web sites to web applications, it is only natural to step into the mobile market, where applications are the center of the ecosystem, while the platform below them does not matter much anymore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch">The</a> <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">first</a> <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">few</a> have made this step and with success!</p>
<p>But all of them are just &ldquo;packaging&rdquo; the web into a native veneer - so they build something around that, what is already part of the platform: The web.</p>
<p>Mozilla is only consequent in taking it further: The web <strong>is</strong> the platform in Firefox OS.</p>
<p>When this attempt is successful, it does not matter, if the web as a mobile platform is called &ldquo;Firefox OS&rdquo;, &ldquo;iOS&rdquo;, &ldquo;Android&rdquo; or whatever - it&rsquo;s the web.</p>
<p>The web is open. The web is everywhere. The web is built upon HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Three powerful and yet emerging technologies that I love. Market shares of Firefox OS? I can&rsquo;t care less, as long as the web wins.</p></article>
