<h1>How to manage building a great software product</h1><p>2013-03-14 10:50:00 GMT</p><article><p>The internet is fast-paced and to build great stuff, it&rsquo;s vital to manage your project properly.</p>

<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll never build something truly great.
You may say &ldquo;Yup, that&rsquo;s obvious&rdquo;. Like everybody does.</p>

<p><strong>The TL;DR:</strong>
* Focus on building what the customer needs
* <strong>You</strong> don&rsquo;t know what the customer needs, so ask the customer early on
* Measure the use of the features, optimize for the <strong>real</strong> top features
* Waterfall doesn&rsquo;t work, the original paper (1983) even says so, <strong>be agile</strong> and deal with it.</p>

<p>But for some reason, whenever I&rsquo;m on an event or I look at fellow developers I hear the same things over and over and over again?</p>

<p>Here are the top 5:
1. The managers give us not enough time and budget to build giant, complex apps and expect the outcome to be great.
2. The deadlines are unrealistic the moment they&rsquo;re set
3. Nobody asked us about it, the decisions were made without the developers
4. We&rsquo;re behind schedule, the set of features is steady (sometimes this is even &ldquo;it actually grows&rdquo;) and the deadline can&rsquo;t be delayed.
5. We don&rsquo;t have time to really think about anything, we just have to code code code.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not coming from people working in the same company. I hear this a lot and thinking back, I encountered that myself as well. Often.</p>

<p>When you ask people who know enough about coding but are in a managing position, I often get the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know, but the management&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a theory that has proven to be right pretty often: The project management gets under pressure from the higher management and doesn&rsquo;t stand their ground, which transitions into putting the pressure on the development team&hellip; which doesn&rsquo;t stand their ground either.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my suggestion to this: When somebody <strong>demands something unrealistic</strong>, tell them about the <strong>Scope Triangle</strong>.</p>

<p>The scope triangle is one of the most-obvious yet most-ignored things in management of IT projects. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.projectsmart.co.uk/img/scope-triangle.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>It means: <strong>From Quality, Time or Money you can pick two or you end up with something shitty.</strong>
You should <a href="http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/project-management-scope-triangle.html"><strong>now read this article</strong></a> for further details on this.<br/>
Seriously, click the link and read that really thoroughly, then come back.</p>

<p>Alright. Now that you understand the key thing there,start by focusing on the <strong>only really important aspect</strong>: The <strong>user</strong>.</p>

<ul><li>If your project <strong>looks really great</strong>, but doesn&rsquo;t really <strong>do the right job perfectly</strong>, it&rsquo;s <strong>shit</strong>.</li>
<li>If your project <strong>has a ton of features</strong>, but doesn&rsquo;t really <strong>do the right job perfectly</strong>, it&rsquo;s <strong>shit</strong>.</li>
<li>If your project <strong>has the best user experience</strong>, but doesn&rsquo;t really <strong>do the right job perfectly</strong>, it&rsquo;s <strong>shit</strong>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Period.</strong> No excuses, no &ldquo;Yeah but&hellip;&rdquo; - the <strong>first thing</strong> you have to release is something <strong>the user wants</strong>. What makes people want something? If it <strong>does something really good</strong>. Everything else is <strong>toys</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you know <strong>what the user needs</strong> or wants? <strong>No you don&rsquo;t.</strong>.<br/>
Try it for yourself, make up something you think a given group of people would love. Then go to a coffee shop and <strong>offer people from that group a coffee</strong> in exchange for <strong>telling them your idea</strong>.<br/>
You&rsquo;ll be surprised how different their desires and needs are from what you had in mind.</p>

<p>Now that you understood how important it is to get the <strong>real user feedback</strong> to your idea (actually even <strong>before having built the first release</strong>), you could do different things:</p>

<ul><li>Create a simple clickable prototype and do the <strong>coffee test</strong> again.</li>
<li>Create a simple <em>real</em> version with only the features you think are the most vital <strong>but not more than one or two features</strong>. Even if you think &ldquo;Oh this is useless to the user, because it&rsquo;s missing XYZ**, do it that way. Then show it to test users and ask them, what they miss. Then extend your product.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Release it early</strong> and have a few early-adopters play with it. <strong>Proactively ask them</strong> and <strong>gather analytics</strong> on how they use your product and what they need.<br/>
Your anticipated killer-feature is not used at all? Throw it out, focus on the most popular thing and direct your design efforts to make this as pretty, easy and useful as possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s generally a really bad idea to go a top-down approach like waterfall. <strong>Be agile</strong>.
It you think &quot;bah, the modern pseudo-management stuff? Never! I trust my waterfall&rdquo;, <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/1983/usccse83-501/usccse83-501.pdf"><strong>you should finally read the original paper from 1983</strong></a> - <strong>focus on the foreword page 2 and following</strong>.
Even the author says it doesn&rsquo;t work that way and they had done <strong>prototypes first</strong> to <strong>minimize uncertainty and risk</strong>.</p>

<p>Money quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great majority seemed to espouse the following approach: we must write the initial top-down specification [&hellip;], so we will know precisely what 
  our objectives are before we produce one line of code. This attitude can be terribly misleading and dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(p. 3, line 13ff. ) and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To stretch an analogy slightly, it is like saying that we must specify the 
  characteristics of a rocket engine before measuring the burning properties of liquid hydrogen.</p>
