<h1>Flip Ahead browsing and a js polyfill </h1><p>2014-01-27 11:00:42 GMT</p><article><p dir="ltr">If you haven&rsquo;t heard of *flip ahead browsing* you are like me a few months ago. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you ever read a blog post or a multi page article on a website on a mobile device and felt the urge to just swipe and get to the next or previous post or page? </p>
<p dir="ltr">No, I don&rsquo;t mean navigating the browser history. I talk about coming to a website for the first time and wanting to get to the next (or previous) logical content, such as the following blog post or page two of the great article you&rsquo;re reading&hellip; </p>
<p dir="ltr">I did feel that urge. It feels natural to &ldquo;turn the page&rdquo; by swiping. </p>
<p dir="ltr">To my surprise, the Internet Explorer has this feature, called &ldquo;flip ahead browsing&rdquo;. If a website, say your blog, supports it and I swipe on a page, it takes me to the URL the page author deems logically &ldquo;next&rdquo; or &ldquo;previous&rdquo;. </p>
<p dir="ltr">When I revamped [Geekonaut] (<a href="http://geekonaut.de">http://geekonaut.de</a>), I implemented flip ahead browsing, so people can swipe to reach the next or previous section, according to main navigation order. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Implementing it is extremely simple and a no-brainer to me:</p>
<p dir="ltr">    &lt;link rel=&ldquo;next&rdquo; href=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; /&gt;<br/>
    &lt;link rel=&ldquo;prev&rdquo; href=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; /&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wonder why Internet Explorer is apparently the only browser that implements this. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Having tried it on a tablet my only concern is, that it clashes with the normal horizontal scrolling and that may be bad. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I agree with the idea of a colleague of mine that it would be good to establish a new convention to use a two-Finger swipe to use this form of navigation. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For this,, I built [a simple Javascript library](<a href="http://github.com/AVGP/flipAhead.js">http://github.com/AVGP/flipAhead.js</a>) that uses the same link syntax but a two-finger swipe to provide flip ahead browsing. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I am, still, not sure if the gesture is obvious or natural enough or if the education is worth the hassle. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I would love your feedback on this. </p></article>
