<h1>Online IDE for developing cross-platform mobile apps in your browser</h1><p>2012-11-05 14:00:24 GMT</p><article><p>If you like the idea of Phonegap (Adobe Cordova, respectively) but don&rsquo;t want to go throught the hassle of installing it on your system and making it work, you now have a <strong>comfortable</strong> way of getting neat results quickly:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.icenium.com">Icenium</a> </strong>offers a <strong>browser-based IDE</strong> and Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) 2.0.0.</p>
<p>Cordova is a framework to build <strong>cross-platform mobile apps</strong> with HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript. The apps run like native apps and UI-Toolkits like Kendo UI try to <strong>emulate the native look&amp;feel of the current platform</strong>.</p>

<p>As a member of the R&amp;D Team at <a href="http://www.centralway.com">Centralway</a> I am always interested in new technologies. This includes the ever-lasting fight between the &ldquo;native apps forever!&rdquo; and the &ldquo;web tech based apps to the rescue!&rdquo; frontiers.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.centralway.com/decadently-digital/">One of our internal apps, the &ldquo;roomClock&rdquo;</a> is a native iOS app and can at the moment only be maintained by our (awesome) mobile developers - but why not have the possibility of everyone in the Factory team being abled to change the code or adjust the layout?</p>

<p>So I looked into PhoneGap. Installing it locally sucked. Hard. I wanted to <strong>get results quickly </strong>and <strong>hassle-free.</strong></p>
<p>This is where Icenium enters the stage. With the browser IDE and the possibility to <strong>run the app</strong> in iOS and Android <strong>simulators</strong> and <strong>easy ways of deploying</strong> to iOS and Android devices I was abled to quickly develop and deploy the roomClock app, that accesses the Google Calendar API and displays the current or the next upcoming event for each room.</p>
<p>(Oh, and last but not least, <a href="https://github.com/martin-naumann/roomClock">the roomClock is open source now</a>.)</p>

<p>Icenium is <strong>free</strong> at the moment (until May 2013). I can only encourage everybody to try it!</p></article>
