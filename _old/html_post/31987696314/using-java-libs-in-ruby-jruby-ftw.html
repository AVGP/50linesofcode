<h1>Using Java-Libs in Ruby: jRuby ftw!</h1><p>2012-09-21 15:49:38 GMT</p><article><p>We have some Grails project we&rsquo;re going to migrate to Ruby over the next months.</p>
<p>But - of course - we have a tight release schedule as well.</p>
<p><strong>So how to switch the language and still be able to ship on time?</strong></p>
<p>In our particular scenario the answer is: We stick with the Java-Libraries the Grails project uses (3rd party stuff) and compile some basic, lower level stuff of the Grails app into JARs as well and use them from Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Using JAR libraries from Ruby? Yep, that is possible with jRuby.</strong></p>
<p>See an example:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3762089">sample Java library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3762229">sample Ruby code</a></li>
<li>sample output</li>
</ul><p>As the example shows, the Sample Java Library even has a dependency to org.json.jar which can be handled as well by JRuby.</p></article>
