<h1>Requirements matter as much as the code</h1><p>2012-07-17 14:27:41 GMT</p><article><p>If you had ever been a web developer doing freelancer projects or ever run your own web agency, you are likely to have made a few mistakes&hellip; and hopefully learnt from them.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about major mistakes in project management in terms of legal documentation: Specifications or requirements in particular.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Specifications are your friend</strong></p>
<p>I know, you want to get the project done. You want to fire up your favorite editor and hack in some code and present your awesome results to your customer. Or maybe your customer urges you, because there is not much time&hellip;</p>
<p>For whatever reason you think you don&rsquo;t need to write down the exact requirements for the project - <strong>you&rsquo;re always wrong</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The specification is your friend</strong>. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe me? Read on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>No, I always said, I wanted it <em>that</em> way!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first problem when doing client work and creating an application or website is, that you and the customer have (at least slightly) <strong>different backgrounds</strong>. They&rsquo;re not developers (if they were, why would they come to you?) - and they talk a <strong>slightly different language</strong>.</p>
<p>For you that means: If you explain the features to the customer and provide a few screenshots only, they might <strong>imagine something</strong>, that you <strong>didn&rsquo;t imagine</strong>. Then there is the time aspect - after having had a lot of<strong> talking, creating and discarding ideas</strong>, making plans, explaining needs you and your customer may not <strong>remember the same things</strong> or understand them slightly different.</p>
<p>An example: You discuss with your customer, that a page should have &ldquo;a very good user experience&rdquo;. What you understand: The page should look shiny, polished and the user can easily navigate through it. Your customer understands: The site should run like a charm in <em>IE6 </em>on a Windows 2000 computer with 800 MHz and an 800x600 screen resolution.</p>
<p>Imagine how it would be to find out about that, after you spent a month to create some super-awesome JS-based rich web application. Yay!</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The tip of the iceberg</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is, that the customer knows exactly what he wants. Usually people tell you, that <strong>customers have no clue about what they want</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s technically <strong>wrong</strong>. They know exactly what they want - but <strong>it&rsquo;s stuck in their head.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you know that problem. Imagine you have a wonderful picture in your head: Colorful, of poetical composition - just awesome. Now you want to share that beautiful idea in your head with others, so you decide to take some canvas and a few brushes and colors and paint it. Depending on how familiar you are with these things, you are more or less likely to be disappointed. The colors are not as shiny as in your head. The shapes are not as sharp and well-composed as in your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>That also happens, when customers ask you to create a piece of software from their ideas.</strong></p>
<p>The problem herein is, that customers <strong>know everything</strong> about their desired software and its <strong>natural</strong> for them to have certain features or have the UI designed in a certain way.</p>
<p>When you ask them to explain it to you, they will talk about the <strong>things that matter in their minds</strong>. But those usually aren&rsquo;t the things that really matter to you!</p>
<p>Having a sorting feature may sound complicated for them but it&rsquo;s a simple task for you as a developer, while knowing what details of a document and what search criteria are most important to the user may not be obvious for you..</p>
<p>This can lead to the problem, that parts of the requirements were never explicitly mentioned by your customer. They only described the <strong>tip of the iceberg </strong>but expect you to <em>know</em> what they implied with that and what they have in their head.</p>

<p>That is the reason, why effort and features explode and you are confronted with a gazillion change requests the customer expects you to throw in for free.</p>

<p><strong>The solution </strong>to that is having really specific requirements and precise descriptions of the things you&rsquo;re gonna build.</p>
<p>So never ever do things like &ldquo;&hellip;will have an intuitive interface&rdquo; - that can mean anything. Make mockups, put them into the attachment and say &ldquo;&hellip;with the userface shown in the attached Mockups and Screenshots&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Never say &ldquo;will work in every browser&rdquo; (really, if you do that, your developers may create a plot to kill you and make it look like an accident!) - your customer may still be using Internet Explorer 5.5 and you don&rsquo;t want to support that.</p>
<p>Be as exact as possible and talk with your customer, ask a lot of questions - don&rsquo;t fall for things like &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo; or that kind of marketing-blah. </p>
<p>Show them screenshots.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb: </strong>If the customer buys what you told them without saying &ldquo;No, can we change that, so that it &hellip;&rdquo; or asking you questions or discussing with you, you weren&rsquo;t specific enough!</p></article>
