<h1>Interoperability</h1><p>2011-04-21 10:00:06 GMT</p><article><p>Nowadays many of use use the services of twitter, facebook, foursquare, tumblr, soup etc. and their number is growing.</p>
<p>This causes two effects:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Segregation of different communities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diffusion of users</strong></li>
</ol><p>The first one is topic of this &lt;ENTER LINK THERE!&gt; post, this post will discuss the second effect, the diffusion.</p>
<p><strong>What does diffusion of users mean?</strong></p>
<p>Observing the growing number of people using communities (or social networks, but I&rsquo;ll summarize both of them in the term &ldquo;community&rdquo; for the scope of this article) shows, that the market provides different providers for the same purposes: Twitter and Identi.ca / <a target="_blank" href="http://www.status.net">Statusnet</a>, Facebook and MySpace and a dozen smaller networks (in Germany for example there are wer-kennt-wen, lokalisten, goolive and some others), Foursquare, Latitude-Check-In,Gowalla, Twitpic, yfrog, flickr, twitgoo, picplz, youtube, vimeo, ..</p>
<p>The positive aspect of this is the competition it imposes on the market, keeping up service quality and innovation at quite a good level.</p>
<p>The downside of this is the diffusion of users. While Facebook gained a decent degree of dominancy in the segment of communities for staying in contact with friends, the situation in other segments isn&rsquo;t that simple (on a closer look even the situation with Facebook is not so simple, considering <a target="_blank" href="https://joindiaspora.com/">diaspora</a> as a rising platform).</p>

<p>The core functionality and purpose of all the communities is communication in various means: On Facebook, I&rsquo;d like to stay in touch with people I know, on Twitter I&rsquo;d like to get and tell interesting news from/to others, on Picplz I want to share impressions with others and enjoy those of others - on youtube I want to watch interesting video footage and share my videos with others.</p>
<p>This works best, when I can get my activities from the platforms directly to all people who may be concerned as receipients - for example it works better, when all my friends I want to share a video with, are on Youtube. When some of them aren&rsquo;t registered on Youtube, but on Vimeo, I don&rsquo;t reach these people directly. Of course - I can reach them using a third party, which <em>often </em>works pretty good as well - Youtube, for example, allows me to put a video link on Facebook automatically.</p>
<p>But the word <strong><em>&ldquo;often&rdquo;</em></strong>Â is the issue. There is no standardized and open way to interchange information between the different platforms - at least, most of the services provide an open API to exchange data between the platforms.</p>
<p>Looking at most of these APIs its obvious, that they&rsquo;re handling pretty similar tasks. Sadly, they&rsquo;re relying on different mechanisms and formats for their data (I don&rsquo;t mean format as in JSON or XML, but more in the content delivered through these containers, like id vs. user_id etc.).</p>

<p>In my opinion, it would be very nice and helpful for interoperability to have a common interface to integrate services with each other, to provide more comfort to the communicating users.</p>
<p>There are approaches to this issue: OAuth for example provides a clearly specified, general mechanism of authorizing access to user data on any platform implementing it (eg. Twitter).</p>
<p>OpenSocial is another project targeting interoperability striving to allow exchanging applications on different platforms implementing the interfaces.</p>
<p>In my opinion we need something going one step further by providing a common way to obtain the data itself and integrate it into the implementing platforms.</p>

<p>If there is such a project, I would be glad to hear about it in the reactions!</p></article>
