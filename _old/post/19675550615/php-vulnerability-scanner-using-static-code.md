#PHP vulnerability scanner using static code analysis
<p>Yesterday I came across <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rips-scanner/">PHP-RIPS</a>, a vulnerability scanner for PHP that uses static code analysis to find possible security issues in your PHP code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I installed and tried it and I must say, that it performs pretty well. Of course, as with every analysis tool, you have some false positives and false negatives, but the results provide useful tips and hints on where to start reviewing your code for possible attack vectors.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As PHP is a language often used by beginners and is widely spread over the web, the risks of being exploited via common pitfalls (e.g. Injections - the #1 Attack Vector (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten">OWASP Top 10 2011</a>), XSS (#2 in OWASP Top 10 2011)) and there aren't too many good and free tools on the market to check for vulnerabilities of your web application, I think that PHP-RIPS is a good step in the right direction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Its fairly simple to use: You extract the archive to your web-root, direct it to the path of your PHP files, set the type of vulnerabilities you want to check for and hit "Scan".</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When done, you will see a pie chart and a list of numbers of possible issues found. You also get a en-detail view of the parts of code in question.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The ease of use and extensiveness makes it a good start, when you want to get an overview of possible issues in your PHP code. And you should really have an eye on that.</p>&#13;
<p>But you should not rely on the scanner too much, as it states, to be "incompatible" with OOP-PHP - but on my tests I found it to be pretty good with object-oriented PHP though.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So if you want to get a starting point for reviewing your PHP application security, you should give it a try. Its fast, its free and its useful to dig into the matter.</p>
