#meteor.js chat example
<p>A few days ago, I discovered <a href="http://www.meteor.com">meteor.js</a> and decided to give it a try.</p>&#13;
<p>After reading the Quick start, the "docs" and modifying the Leaderboard example, to get a short dive-in, I found it pretty nice to work with it.</p>&#13;
<p>Thats why I decided to write an example on my own - I decided to make a chat example. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/AVGP/meteor.js-chat-example">GitHub</a> or try it <a href="http://chat-example.meteor.com">here</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The only problem I see with meteor.js at the moment is, that the documentation seems to be incomplete and too short in some points. I recommend following the discussions around meteor.js in their IRC channel (#meteor on freenode) to get the best insights.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I guess I'll give <a href="http://emberjs.com">ember.js</a> / <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockout.js</a> a try in the next days. </p>
