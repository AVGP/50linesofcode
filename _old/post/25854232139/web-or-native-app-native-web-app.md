#Web or native app? Native web app!
<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>&#13;
<p>I have been following the discussions about the future of desktop, mobile and web apps development for a while now.</p>&#13;
<p>Up to now it has been a game of ping-pong: "Native" - "Web" - "Native!" - "Web!"... a never ending game.</p>&#13;
<p>But thanks to Mozilla, this could change in the near future.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Boot to Gecko and Mozilla Apps</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Mozilla embraces the web. I love that.</p>&#13;
<p>Today I visited the Mozilla "Weekend of Code" in Zurich and had a great time there.</p>&#13;
<p>There is a lot of interesting things going on - among them two which extends the possible ways to go when developing applications for computers, the web and the mobile devices: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Apps/Apps_JavaScript_API" target="_blank">Native web apps</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pQgP1WUm4&amp;feature=g-hist" target="_blank">B2G</a> mobile platform.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Native web apps</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Mozilla is developing the "Apps" APIs and a marketplace - but this one (in contrast to the Chrome Web Store) allows to install the apps as native applications on your desktop. No matter if it's Mac, Windows or Linux. Or in the future even your phone.</p>&#13;
<p>The Apps are nothing else than web apps - a mix of HTML5, JS and CSS. You add a manifest JSON file and have Mozilla do the rest.</p>&#13;
<p>And the best: It really feels native - I tried it on my Xfce4-debian squeeze eeePc.</p>&#13;
<p>Click the "install" button on the web page, confirm. That's it. No more downloads, no more tinkering. The app just sits in the menu, starts and runs as every other app. The same applies for Mac.</p>&#13;
<p>Love it.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Boot to Gecko</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Boot to Gecko (short: B2G) is Mozillas approach to take away the Java from Android and put some web stack on your phone. Enhanced with APIs for the native functionality (as Calls, SMS, etc.). So basically it allows you to write apps and control all features from within web apps you build with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>&#13;
<p>Yes. You can do everything within all the web stuff. Make calls. Send SMS. Take pictures. Everything. In Javascript. Yes. It's real.</p>&#13;
<p>It's just not stable, it's in the development phase.</p>&#13;

<p>I really look forward to it becoming stable.</p>
