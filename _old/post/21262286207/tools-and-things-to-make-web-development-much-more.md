#Tools and things to make web development much more fun
<p>Web developers nowadays have a lot of possibilities to increase the pace of development and make the process from developing to deploying the app much more fun.</p>&#13;
<p>There is a bunch of good IDEs (<a href="http://www.goincloud.com" target="_blank">even</a> <a href="https://kodingen.com/" target="_blank">web-based</a> <a href="http://c9.io/" target="_blank">ones</a>), there are a lot of cool tools for testing your work and build/deploy management (<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/">capistrano</a> / <a href="capifony.org" target="_blank">capifony</a> / <a href="http://mink.behat.org/" target="_blank">mink</a> / <a href="http://behat.org/" target="_blank">behat</a> / <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">cucumber</a>).</p>&#13;
<p>There are countless frameworks for a bunch of different programming languages - some of them well-known, like Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Groovy, Django, web.py, Plone, Grok,Zend_Framework, Symfony2, CakePHP, Yii, CodeIgniter, Lithium, Spring, JSF, GWT, ASP MVC, DotNetNuke or Wt for C++.</p>&#13;
<p>But there are some not widely-known ones, using JavaScript, like <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> or - and I will cover it later on in more detail: <a href="http://meteor.com/">meteor.js</a></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The essence of this is: Take some time to look around what is out there. It will give you useful insights and inspiration and last, but not least, it gives you some more tools for your toolbox to encounter new problems with new solutions.</p>
