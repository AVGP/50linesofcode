#Quick tip: Designing your own REST API
<p>If you want to set up a REST API for your project, you will quickly see a lot of questions arise, especially if you've been working with a few different APIs yourself.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul><li>Should URLs use plural or singular?</li>&#13;
<li>How to deal with clients that can't do real REST (e.g. IE 8 Javascript has issues with cross-origin HTTP-PUT and DELETE)?</li>&#13;
<li>How should URLs look like? Should they have verbs inside?</li>&#13;
<li>How to version the API?</li>&#13;
<li>And a lot more.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>The answer to some of these questions is: Whatever you like better.</p>&#13;
<p>But I have been looking around for some advice from people who are focused on API stuff day in day out.</p>&#13;
<p>Now I want to share my findings with you:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Apigee</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Apigee is a company that helps you run your API, so you don't have to deal with performance, rate limiting, etc.</p>&#13;
<p>They have quite a high-line profile of customers: AT&amp;T, ComCast, Gamespy, Getty Images, ebay, Dell, Swift, Moneybookers and a bunch of other well-known names.</p>&#13;
<p>The interesting thing: <strong>They have a blog and a free e-book</strong> about API Design<strong>.</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="http://blog.apigee.com/taglist/rest_api_design?page=3">The Blog posts</a> have been collected and put together as a <a href="http://apigee.com/about/content/web-api-design">free e-book</a> and they have <a href="http://apigee.com/about/api-best-practices/all/ebook">some more</a> available for purchase or download.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>API Craft Google Group</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The other useful thing I stumbled upon is the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft Group</a> where a lot of people actively discuss API design questions, do's&amp;don'ts and it is really insightful to read the discussions.</p>&#13;
