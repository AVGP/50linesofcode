#JetStrap - create Bootstrap layouts via Drag&Drop
<p>The <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> layout kit from Twitter allows web developers to quickly build appealing frontend designs that just work.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>What Bootstrap can do</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Bootstrap supports fluid grid layouts, has a growing number of predefined color schemes and components like multi-level context menus, button dropdowns, javascript dialogs, different kinds of navigation concepts, Breadcrumbs, Pagination components, Badges, Alerts, fancy progressbars and typography helpers and some more.</p>&#13;
<p>While Bootstrap sometimes is called overused, I think that Bootstrap helps developers who are not into fiddling with CSS for an hour to get a grid matching their expected results or to include the full jQuery UI just to get some basic UI components.</p>&#13;
<p>Especially it helps speeding up the prototyping and initial release phase by making it easy to get something to look decent with it, though in the long run you want to customize and improve your design incrementally based on what you got in a few minutes with Bootstrap.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>JetStrap - rapid design prototyping even more rapid</strong></p>&#13;
<p>With <a href="http://www.jetstrap.com">JetStrap</a> the process of drafting your basic layout is even easier: You just drag&amp;drop and use the visual interface to build what you want to see. JetStrap even allows you to dynamically preview how it would look like on different screen sizes (mobile phone, tablet, small screen, wide screen).</p>&#13;
<p>This way you can easily and quickly create a basic layout and download them as a ZIP with all the files.</p>&#13;
