#The pace of technology - a tiny review
I'd just like to give you an idea of the velocity of change in technology and how much of an impact this has on our everyday life.

When I had my first computer experience on a Commodore 64 I was learning everything from a book. **A book** that had a few hundred pages printed on paper.

The best I could get were a few programs written in BASIC or, later, assembly language. They could draw stuff on screen, react to keyboard or joystick input and were rather simple games.

Then I got a PC. If I wanted it to do something new I'd go to a shop, buy a bunch of CDs and install the software. After **a few hours** (taking the time to go to the shop until the program was running for the first time) you then had a shiny new toy.

Then I learned programming [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)s. That was a very different experience, as it is much more event-driven than the classical [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL)-style programs I wrote.

Back then the only way I could exchange my software with others was a **floppy disk** with the **CD writer** just being the hottest (and pretty expensive) piece of hardware.

Then I finally came online - and it was a revolution: I could run a small website with my software on it and **within weeks a few hundred people were running code that I had written**.

I could exchange information within a blink of the eye, download new software, learn a new trick in software development and distribute my work worldwide - **new things were minutes away**.

Then I built a few tools myself to share pictures, ebooks, texts and hosted them myself as **services just started to pop up** throughout the net.

Back then I switched from a few megabytes shared web space to a **virtual server**. It would cost around 15â‚¬/month and it took a contract and a few days to set up.

Then the **cloud era** began.

You could now spin up and shut down servers as you went along. **It took a click**. No paperwork, no waiting.
And with **servers becoming a commodity**, services became a commodity, too.

I didn't have to host my software, my code, my pictures, music books or anything else myself anymore - it was a matter of clicks now.

And this is today - things that required knowledge of how to run a server or how to configure a whole range of pieces to get something online are now easily and readily available for almost everybody.

But as a word of warning: **We need to make sure it stays that way**.
I highly encourage you to look at the [unhosted initiative](https://unhosted.org/), at the [indie web](http://indiewebcamp.com/) and interesting projects such as the [indie phone](http://indiephone.eu/).
