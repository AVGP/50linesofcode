#Why meteor.js kicks ass - Talk at Codebits 2012
<p>This year I had the pleasure to give a talk about <a href="http://www.meteor.com">meteor.js</a> at the <a href="http://www.codebits.eu">Codebits</a> in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>&#13;
<p>The slides of my talk <a href="http://www.rvl.io/avgp/less_coding_more_awesome">are available here</a>, there is also a <a href="http://videos.sapo.pt/APltO4w12p4KpzVmqhoL">video of it</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>If you don't want to listen to me talking or don't like to read slides, but want the real deal:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AVGP/meteor.js-chat-example">Here</a> is a simple example multi-room chat</li>&#13;
<li><a href="https://github.com/AVGP/meteordesk">Here</a> is the repository from the talk, that does a chat with IMAP integration.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask!</p>
