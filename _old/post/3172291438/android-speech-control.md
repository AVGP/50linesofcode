#Android Speech Control
<p>Recently I've been creating an Android App to enable fully adaptable speech-command-control for my phone.</p>&#13;
<p>The App is called "Geniedroid" and can be customized to react on any keyword you want with a variety of different actions:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Call: You can call a predefined contact or the contact mentioned after the keyword.</li>&#13;
<li>SMS: Go to the SMS composer to compose an SMS for the contact mentioned after the keyword or a predefined contact.</li>&#13;
<li>Run: Run the app previously linked to that keyword in the config.</li>&#13;
<li>Search: Do a web-search for the term mentioned after the keyword or perform a predefined query.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>The keywords itself are chosen by you. For example, you may bind the keyword "Photo" to launching the camera-app - or you may prefer linking this action to the keyword "Cam". Its up to you!</p>&#13;
<p>If you want to give it a try, <a href="http://www.file-upload.net/download-3160627/GenieDroid.zip.html">you can find the file here</a>. GenieDroid is tested with Android 2.1 - may run with lower versions.</p>
