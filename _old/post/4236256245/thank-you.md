#Saying thank you, the datalove-way
<p>As I mentioned in the <a target="_blank" href="ox86.tumblr.com/post/4157119185/from-data-and-information">last article here</a>, there is a new, uprising movement in the internet-community: The <a target="_blank" href="http://datalove.me">dataloverz</a>. I greatly appreciate this!</p>&#13;
<p>As part of the principles, we've fired up a sweet, small system to say "Thank you" to people, who have contributed to our daily life in some ways.</p>&#13;
<p>For example, I really like to thank towo, tomate, authmill, vIiRuS and lotta for being so nice to have set the whole datalove-thing up and gave us this nice thing!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And here we go! We have give.datalove to show our appreciation! Its free, its easy and its fun! Share your "datalovez" with others, receive some back for providing help or just being yourself! Spread the word! Let the data flow!</p>&#13;
<p>Additionally it provides a widget for your webpage to tell people, you're part of the dataloverz and allow them to give you their datalove!</p>&#13;
<p>Wanna have a glance? See <a title="http://give.datalove.me" target="_blank">http://give.datalove.me</a>!</p>&#13;
<p>You may say thank you, using this one here:</p>&#13;
