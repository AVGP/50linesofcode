#Streamlining public communication in social media
<p>Social Media nowadays has a lot of faces, for me there are 4 main channels</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Facebook</li>&#13;
<li>Twitter</li>&#13;
<li>Xing / LinkedIn</li>&#13;
<li>Tumblr</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Up to now, I did not think much of what-to-post-where and any guidelines to decide, whom to follow where and to make a difference in putting content up.</p>&#13;
<p>Obviously, on LinkedIn and Xing, I only put things related to my profession - but the other channels got a pretty wide mix of topics and different ways of articulating.</p>&#13;
<p>This was nothing worth rethinking, as long as the "audience" on all channels was pretty much the same. Some time ago, this began shifting enormously.</p>&#13;
<p>Thus, I created a small policy to streamline the usage of the different channels.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Twitter is mostly a knowledge- and news-sharing network. People I follow or I am followed by share some interest in any way and got something interesting to show to others. Here I will be following people publishing things interesting to me and will publish things interesting to people sharing any of my interests.</p>&#13;
<p>This will include jokes and some not-too-serious stuff, but the private-life will be spared.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>&#13;
<p>I found myself primarily using Facebook to stay in touch with people, I at least shared a significant period of time of my real life. Here I share things I consider partly personal - photographs of the family, etc. I only want to share these things with my closer friends. This is a good practice, as my friends spread around the country and this is the most comfortable, most effective way for me to stay in touch with them frequently and intensely.</p>&#13;
<p>The policy here is, that I will remove people I do not interact on a private basis with - i.e. Colleagues, People I never met in real life and people, I share a period of lifetime but don't interact with anymore.</p>&#13;
<p>New people will only be added, if (private-life based) interaction is likely to happen and I met them before.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Xing / LinkedIn</strong></p>&#13;
<p>These platforms are completely dedicated to my professional background. Here I will network with my colleagues, customers and people interesting for business opportunities. The only point I am not sure of is, if I will continue interacting with people I haven't met before. At this moment, I think I will, because these platforms work best, when they're used to get in touch with <em>new</em> people. Not adding people I haven't met yet would counteract upon this aspect.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Tumblr</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Tumblr will stay the same - its a kind of blog for me. I will put up articles and share some generic thoughts here and I will follow the community to find more of the interesting things circulating on tumblr.</p>
