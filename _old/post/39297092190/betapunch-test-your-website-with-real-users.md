#BetaPunch - test your website with real users
<p>When you launch a new website, you may want to have some users tell you, what they think of it and if they understand, how to use it properly.</p>&#13;
<p>User feedback tests are usually conducted in a usability lab, where users are filmed while using the website and performing a list of predefined tasks. This happens under supervision of experts, who create a detailed analysis afterwards.</p>&#13;
<p>For a Startup or a side-project, those studies are not only too expensive, but also too detailed.</p>&#13;
<p>An easier and cheaper (you actually get your <strong>first test for free!</strong>) way is <a href="http://www.betapunch.com/signup/refer/50df7bafd921a">BetaPunch</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>You submit your website, select a demographic (location, tech expertise, age and gender) and write down some questions or tasks you want the user to answer or perform.</p>&#13;
<p>Testers pick it up (pretty quickly, it took 2 hours for me, until the tester submitted his feedback) and record their screen along with spoken comment of what they think, what they like or dislike and what they don't understand. You can see and listen to the tester using your website. And they give great feedback.</p>&#13;
<p>When you're done you can rate their test or send them a message.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It is definitely worth a try and helps you with invaluable feedback on how to make your site more appealing to your (potential) users and improve your user experience.</p>
