#Debugging the mobile web on your computer with Chrome Dev Tools
Today I randomly stumbled upon an extremely useful feature in the dev tools of Chrome, that I have missed so far:

**Emulating sensors, screen sizes, touch events and more** in the Chrome developer tools.

To be use this feature, you need to:

1. Open the developer tools
2. Open the developer tools settings (little gear icon)
3. a. On Chrome Stable, you need to check "Show 'Emulation' view in console drawer." in the general section.
    b. On Chrome Beta, go to the "Override" panel and check the "Show 'Emulation' view in console drawer." option.
4. Press "Esc" in the developer tools and click on "Emulate".

More details on how to use the features can be found [in this article](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/mobile-emulation?hl=de).
