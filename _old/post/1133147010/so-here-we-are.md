#So, here we are.
<p>Hello people, hello web, hello tumblr.com!</p>&#13;
<p>Some of you might know me already, some of you might not. It doesn't matter anyway.</p>&#13;
<p>For the people mentioned first, this is a comeback - a startover -, for the latter, a voice from above may say:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>And he said "This shall be my blog, though shall be reading it" - and it was his blog. And you were reading it.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Â Basically, this is a welcome post.</p>&#13;
<p>Nearly every blog you may find has some kind of this. Usually the content is boring and could easily be replaced by some <a title="Lorem Ipsum" target="_blank" href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>. That directly applies to this post, sadly enough.</p>&#13;
<p>To get the already-too-long-story short: This is my new blog and I'll use it mostly for commenting about my projects, interesting things, I stumbled upon (not neccessarily using <a title="StumbleUpon" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, which is pretty cool though) and tech-related stuff.</p>&#13;
<p>So long and thanks for all the fish!</p>&#13;
<p>AVGP</p>
