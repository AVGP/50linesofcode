#The future is hybrid... or is it?
After my talk at Future of web apps in October 2013 in London, I got interviewed by Louise from Future Insights about the future of mobile apps and why I was talking about hybrid apps.

You can find [the article here](http://www.futureinsights.com/home/firefox-os-and-the-future-of-hybrid-apps.html) - but I can't stress enough, that *hybrid isn't the future, it's a vehicle*. A vehicle for the mobile web apps.

Right now we have to cut a few corners to deliver the best user experience on mobile with web technologies. Many users are still bound to the marketplaces (where Mozilla's approach of "installing the web" is having the potential to change the game) and many device features are still only released as APIs for native applications.

To unlock these two, often business-relevant, features you have to either [go hybrid](http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/11/web-designers-phonegap.html) in [some](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/17/best-of-both-worlds-mixing-html5-native-code/) way or you go native.

Native, however, locks you in whereas hybrid only does to a certain degree (depending on the strategy you chose).

So, for now, I think some sort of hybrid approach is the vehicle to help us move the app makers into the web universe and work all together towards an even-more competitive web platform.
