#Android App Market Problems
<p>Recently I had some trouble downloading apps from the Market.</p>&#13;
<p>Every download I started, hung shortly after with "Download starting...".</p>&#13;
<p>Searching the web brought up advices like "Set Google Talk to invisible, then to available again" and things like that. I have to confess: I did several things in a particular order, so I can only make some guesses. I'll cover them all below.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul><li>First possible solution: Get another google-account. You don't need to delete the old one, just disable synchronization for a moment. I registered a completely new account from scratch, directly after this the problem was gone.</li>&#13;
<li>Second possible solution: If you're only on WiFi (and behind a NAT [i.e. a router]) try allowing traffic on Port 5228 (I set both, TCP and UDP). So you basically need a port-forwarding.</li>&#13;
<li>Third possible solution: Clear the cache and/or data of the download manager and the market, then try again</li>&#13;
<li>Forth possible solution: Shout at the Market for not working. Take away his gameboy, if neccessary ;)</li>&#13;
</ul><p>I hope that this'll help the people with this problem, since googling brought up more questions, then giving answers...</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Stay tuned</p>&#13;
