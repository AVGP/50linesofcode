#Why developers should learn to estimate and estimate often
Developers are sometimes a grumpy set of people.

To a certain extent, I understand my fellow developers - deadlines are tight, features creep in and out from time to time and uncertainty is your daily companion.

Asking the right questions before starting to hack away is crucial but pretty hard at the same time.

It's hard, because it's likely that you never did something alike and before sitting down and thinking it through carefully it's hard to ask the interesting questions to other stakeholders.

**So why would you do that?**

First of all, estimations help everyone to **get the expectations straight**.
That tough deadline is in two weeks but the estimated work says 2 months? Well, then there's some sort of problem and you should talk about that.

The work is finished faster than expected? Well, then you may have a problem as well (somebody may have missed important bits &amp; pieces or the code is poorly written, docs may be missing, ...)

**What can be the reasons that estimations are wrong?**

There's a pretty long list. My top 3:

1.) The task wasn't thought-through. Sub-task were missed, uncertainties weren't identified or the requirements weren't documented.
2.) A lack of experience. It takes some try&amp;error to get a feeling for the common tasks and problems.
3.) [Scope creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) happened between the estimation and the (delayed) delivery.

Yes, in __that__ particular order.

**How do do better estimations?**

That's not a one-shot thing. It took me a couple of attempts to get to acceptable and apropriate estimations for different tasks. Basically you oscillate around the right estimation - sometimes you're over, sometimes you're under, but you should always aim to make it as close as possible.
If you get your performance to +/- 5%, you're good.
For example: In sprints of one week I tried to be within 2 hours of my estimations. I am pretty sure I never reached that goal, but I wasn't too bad at it (I think).
