#Disaster Response
<p><strong>"Failure is not an option!"</strong></p>&#13;
<p>I don't know how often I heard this sentence but I know for sure that it makes me chuckle.</p>&#13;
<p>The world just doesn't work that way - failure happens. That does not mean you should not care - failure is bad, probably really bad, and you should do everything you can to prevent it.</p>&#13;
<p>But saying "It does not happen" is dumb, because when it happens (and it will), it hits you unprepared.</p>&#13;
<p>If you now object to what I just said and go "You're wrong! Failure can be prevented. You just have to be truly awesome!" I want to remind you that anyone encountered failure - there is an endless list of big companies which had failures in productive systems in the past:</p>&#13;

I could go on for hours.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>So what is the best you could do?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>First of all: <strong>Accept it will happen</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>As a manager it is not the best idea to tell everyone "Failure is not an option and won't be tolerated.". You surely mean that everyone should do their best to prevent a failure. But what people understand it: "If there is a failure and I am somewhat responsible, the manager is my enemy - he wont support me".</p>&#13;
<p>That is the worst thing you could do. People will try to hide a failure or will waste time thinking who they could blame it on, so it's not them being yelled at. This takes away the chance of early reactions and support for the people in charge of fixing the problem(s).</p>&#13;
<p>Better make clear, that you focus on solving problems as a team. To communicate clearly and honestly to each other and that mistakes may happen, but everyone needs to do everything possible to prevent them from happening.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Stay calm, don't yell and have a plan.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>This is the hardest one. Your blood pressure probalby will roar to the sky, all telephone lines may start to ring uninterruptedly, your instant messenger will explode and the number of unread emails will explode.</p>&#13;
<p>I am training this for years now and still there are situations, where I fail to follow this one.</p>&#13;
<p>The best thing to keep in mind during a disaster situation (you may say it to yourself or others as well, if it helps): <strong>"We are working hard on this and it will be well soon."</strong>Â </p>&#13;
<p>Do not induce any additional stress. You need to wait for a database restore and that takes a few hours?</p>&#13;
<p>Fine.</p>&#13;
<p>Do whatever else you can. Calm down upset customers. Prepare crisis communication for later on, maybe start writing the "post mortem" report for the lessons learned afterwards. Don't worry. If you have done everything you can, grab a coffee or some ice cream. It's not helpful to run around in circles. Watch the recovery process, respond to the tasks popping up.</p>&#13;
<p>This gets easier, if you have guidelines or some experience (for example from disaster drills) with those situations, because you can just stick to them in the moment when you will sweat adrenaline and a crowd with torches and forks is approaching you.</p>&#13;
<p>Let me sum it up for you:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Accept there will be disasters and prepare for them</li>&#13;
<li>When the time has come, communicate it and stay calm</li>&#13;
<li>Recovery processes may take time, don't worry. Talk with everyone about the time frame it will take. Don't estimate for the "best case" - you're in the worst case right now.</li>&#13;
<li>Wrap it up. Learn from it, improve things and communicate improvements.</li>&#13;
</ol><p>Nobody is perfect - as the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(fictional)">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" puts it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_panic">Don't panic.</a></p>
