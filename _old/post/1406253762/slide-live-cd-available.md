#Slide: Live-CD available!
<p>As mentioned in my last article, I am currently building a desktop environment, called Slide (Simple, Lightweight, Individual Desktop Environment).</p>&#13;
<p>Slide has a very small amount of dependencies: An X Server, wxWidgets-X11 (preferable 2.8.11 at the moment), libpng, libjpeg and libtiff (and as well libc and libstdc++).</p>&#13;
<p>The core itself is only ~52 kb in size and contains a window manager and communication sockets, the core applications (Desk, "Starter" and Tray) are approx. 260 kb in Size. wxWidgets takes ~ 10 MB and X with a few 100 MB makes a complete system around 120 MB in size.</p>&#13;
<p>Please note, that Slide is in a very early stage and I appreciate any contributions - let it be programming apps for it, working on the core, artwork, testing or whatever you want to do.</p>&#13;

<p>If you want to have a look at it, <a title="Slide on GitHub" target="_blank" href="http://github.com/AVGP/SLIDE">see it on GitHub</a>!</p>&#13;
<p>There are two branches: master, which is considered stable and should not be merged with experimental without being 100% sure what you do there - and experimental, where the newest features are implemented, but not tested against a live environment.</p>&#13;
<p>As you might encounter trouble with your system-configuration or might not to risk running Slide in its early stage on your computer now, I provide a Debian-based Live-CD.</p>&#13;
<p><a title="Slide Live CD" target="_blank" href="http://depositfiles.com/files/uynbe428o">Get the Live-CD here!</a>Â (Takes ~ 355 MB)</p>&#13;
<p>Just put it in your drive, start and enjoy. You might as well load the ISO in some virtual machine, of course.</p>&#13;

<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>
