#Why auphonics is nice when you are podcasting
<p>I recently started <a href="http://codecast.geekonaut.de" target="_blank">a podcast</a> (in German) and was overwhelmed by the resonance I got for it.</p>&#13;
<p>My first experience with podcasting was: Audacity crashed a few times randomly and recording podcasts with it was not really enjoyable. I ditched it and recorded it with a simpler audiorecorder. </p>&#13;
<p>That, in turn, made it an extra step to normalize and denoise the sound file. I decided to leave out those post-production steps. But listeners noticed a low volume and some noise in the recording then.</p>&#13;
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/smnkrl">@smnkrl</a> pointed me to <a href="https://auphonic.com/">Auphonic</a>. It allows to upload a bunch of audio formats and does denoise and normalization automatically, if you wish it to.</p>&#13;
<p>It offers even more than just that (which is the baseline for me):</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Upload of cover image</li>&#13;
<li>Splitting on chapters and chapter marks</li>&#13;
<li>Choose the output format and bitrate</li>&#13;
<li>Filtering and adaptive leveling</li>&#13;
<li>Upload to SFTP, FTP or Dropbox after production.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>And it's <strong>all free</strong>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To me the service seems to be pretty reliable and works perfect. This way, podcast production works like a charm for me.</p>
