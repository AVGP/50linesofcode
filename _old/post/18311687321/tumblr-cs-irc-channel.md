<p>Yeah, a few of us were brainstorming starting one for the group of us in this tumblr CS circuit that would use it in situations where conversing via reblog is a pain in the ass.<br />Right now it’s just myself, eccentric-nucleus, foldingcookie, and c1QfXUgcGY0.<br /><br />Server: irc.synirc.net/6667<br />Channel: #tumblcode</p>&#13;
<p>Addendum: I’m tagging everyone who might be interested.</p>&#13;

<p>Awesome idea - thanks for the invite. Reblogging for other CS/CP folk to see.</p>&#13;
