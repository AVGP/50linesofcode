#Ignite talks coming to Zurich!
## So what's an ignite talk?
Quoting from [the ignite show website](http://www.igniteshow.com/howto):

    Imagine that you’re in front of an audience made up of your friends, family, and people from your community, about to present a 5-minute talk on the thing you’re most passionate about.  
    You’ve brought 20 slides, which advance every 15 seconds whether you’re ready or not.   
    You have a few last-minute butterflies, but off you go—and the crowd loves it. Welcome to Ignite.

Others have explained it, too: [here](http://scottberkun.com/2009/how-to-give-a-great-ignite-talk/) or [here](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/08/while-i-was-in-portland-oregon-last-month-i-kept-meeting-people-who-raved-about-ignite-whats-ignite-id-say-kind-of-like.html).


While ignite started as a geek event, I found it to be a great way to share experiences and ideas with a diverse audience - any topic is welcome and the format makes you distill the juicy bits together and helps you to avoid getting sidetracked into tricky details.

## Getting started with ignite talks in Zurich

With [Ignite groups and events all over the world](http://igniteshow.com/cities/all) now it's time Zurich gets a chance to spread ideas and inspire, too.

This is why I just created the [Ignite Zurich community](http://www.meetup.com/Ignite-Zurich/) to open up this opportunity to people in and around Zurich - it doesn't matter if you ever did an ignite talk - or any public speaking at all - before or if public speaking is part of your daily business.

I will do my best to *make the community a space to explore, experiment and exchange* using the ignite method.

## Like the idea?

If you like what you just read, I invite you to [join the community](http://www.meetup.com/Ignite-Zurich/) and give it a go at our meetups.
