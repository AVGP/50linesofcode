#Test your website design with 5 second tests
<p>If you have a mockup or final design and you want to find out, how your potential visitors would react, what they think of it or if they even understand it, you should conduct a 5 second test.</p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://fivesecondtest.com/">FiveSecondTest.com</a>Â allows you to upload a screenshot or mockup picture and ask a bunch of questions to the users.</p>&#13;
<p>The test is run by showing the image for 5 seconds and presenting the questions to the tester afterwards.</p>&#13;
<p>There is a <strong>free plan</strong> you can leverage by earning Karma points. You can do so by taking tests for others.</p>&#13;
<p>As each test only takes 5 seconds, you quickly get a bunch of results.</p>&#13;
<p>Be sure to make your questions exact enough. Questions like "Do you like the design" don't work (you'll end up with answers like "yes" or "no" without specification on why)</p>&#13;
