#Bootstrapping your hyper-awesome new website
<p>or better: How it's <strong>not</strong> going to work.</p>&#13;
<p>The sad thing is: The inspiration for this post comes from an actual inquiry.</p>&#13;
<p>As you click on some link bringing you here, you may have something you want to promote, to get started - like a rocket, if possible!</p>&#13;
<p>So let's say you have this <strong>hyper-mega-awesome</strong> site, that <strong>kicks ass</strong> and you now <em>just</em> need to drive people to it and you will be <strong>richer</strong> than Apple in just <strong>a few weeks</strong>!</p>&#13;
<p>The hardest part was getting the site up and running, right? Right?!</p>&#13;
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Why is that? Well - first of all, you have total control about everything related to bringing the site up: Development and design(either because you did it on your own or you picked someone to do it), choosing and registering the domain, getting hosting, etc.</p>&#13;
<p>Setting up a website is easier then ever - you can set up impressive things - even with a few hours at hand and without a lot of know-how. This is why a lot of people have "web agencies" nowadays. But that is another story.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Why getting people to your site and keep 'em is hard</strong></p>&#13;
<p>The first thing you have no direct control of is: Your visitors.</p>&#13;
<p>You may be abled to create some buzz using techniques like Link-Building, buying advertisements, harassing your friends or even sending spam emails.</p>&#13;
<p>Now look at your web analytics - wow! So many visitors and hits! We're done now, right? Right??</p>&#13;
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Having people hit your site once or twice does not make your page successful or turns you into a gazillionaire. Because people click on a link, wondering what wonderland may be hidden behind it and check out your site. After a few seconds and clicks (if you're lucky, most people give it a glance and leave straight away, if there is nothing catching their attention) they decide if your site is worth <em>something. </em></p>&#13;
<p>What that something is depends on the type of website you have:</p>&#13;
<p>For a news portal or blog: Good, interesting articles, published regularly.</p>&#13;
<p>For a shopping platform: A lot of good deals for a lot of different things</p>&#13;
<p>For a fun website: A lot of original, new media, frequently updated.</p>&#13;
<p>You get the big picture: Have <em><strong>useful</strong></em> content, that is what people expect from your site (I wouldn't expect shopping deals on superfunnyurlexample.com, for example).</p>&#13;
<p>If your page does not have something useful, people will leave your site. <strong>And they won't come back easily,</strong> because they memorize your page as "It made me click a link to it, but there was nothing interesting. It's not keeping up with its promises. It's bad."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Engage the audience, let them generate content</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Let us go for a news site, specialized in Tech. You picked a hard way to go, because there are a lot of these sites, and they're good: <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://www.mashable.com">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> - and this is what comes to my mind after 2 seconds of thinking.</p>&#13;
<p>First thing you need to compete with these is: Original, good content.</p>&#13;
<p>So you need authors.</p>&#13;
<p>But why is someone writing articles? Well, there is a lot of reasons. But at the end of the day, an author wants to reach his audience - and the audience should be as huge as possible.</p>&#13;
<p>Writing an article takes effort. It takes time and thoughtful wording, some research, blah blah. So where would you put your article? Somewhere, where all the people go everyday to look for new articles or at some site just starting.</p>&#13;
<p>Well, that sounds more obvious then it really is, because there are reasons for going to a freshly started site:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Less crowded means more prominence for your articles, less competition with other articles</li>&#13;
<li>If there is something disruptive or revolutionary about the new website, you may be one of the first people to benefit from that.</li>&#13;
<li>If you are one of the few authors, you may get special assistance and/or goodies from the people running the site</li>&#13;
</ol><p>This works not only for news sites, this works for all of them, because there are three general mechanisms behind these three items on the list from above:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Promote your early-adopters and include them in your own marketing efforts, for example by featuring them in your ad campaigns.</li>&#13;
<li>Highlight the unique selling points you have - and engage your early-adopters in further development and listen to their ideas, they may know best what has to be changed to draw people to your site.</li>&#13;
<li>Give incentives. Give them a promotion shirt, or invite them to join you at some conference, or give them one of the hot-shit so they can do something in relation with your site with it.</li>&#13;
</ol><p>And that's about it.</p>&#13;
<p>If you don't value your early-adopters and/or content-generators (writing reviews, putting in pictures, texts, whatever your site is about) - why should they value you and your site?</p>&#13;
<p>The answer is: <strong>They don't.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>So don't forget: Your rocket is just about to get started - it is not in the sky yet. So don't think your site has a value, because it is a god-damn rocket. It may explode on the ground, when you don't push it.</p>
