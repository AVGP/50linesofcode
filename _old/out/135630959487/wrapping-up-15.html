<p>Now that I am winding down a bit, I get to take a look back at what's been a wonderful, crazy year. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you, chronologically, the many people I got to meet or meet again, the things that happened and left their impression on me and take a glimpse into 2016. So if you wonder what's been on my mind: read on.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mCIRX7r.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>At <a href="http://beta.archilogic.com">Archilogic</a> we've made a range of big leaps forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>We've rolled out Virtual Reality support for Google Cardboard and Oculus Rift</li>
<li>We improved our realistic lighting pipeline, which is now faster, easily scalable and much more flexible.</li>
<li>We have and still constantly do improve on our user experience, giving it faster loading times, more intuitive controls and better visual quality</li>
<li>Besides OBJ we can now also export to DXF</li>
<li>We have improved our image recognition to create 3D models from 2D floorplans</li>
<li>We are about to launch a few amazing features that I can't talk about yet ;-)</li>
<li>We contributed back to open source, for instance to jQuery and Three.js</li>
</ul>
<p>I got to play with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mxAVD8n_P8">LEAP Motion</a>, the Myo, the Oculus Rift and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIslXPfvrlE">Google Tango</a> as well.</p>
<p>I also had the humbling experience of visiting the LHC at CERN and go inside this impossible structure.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8onJq3d.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Also, we've grown our amazing team with great new members - it's a pleasure working with each and every one of our team members for me!</p>
<p>As a bonus, I got to play around with Open Data from Zurich:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zyrnPW7.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>I am also so absolutely blown away and grateful to have a chance to meet so many bright, kind and amazing people and talk to so many different communities all over the world.</p>
<p>It's been a dazzling <strong>21 events</strong> in <strong>17 different countries</strong> I got to visit this year! I am out of words for how humbled I am by this - I really hope that I could provide something insightful, useful and fun for each of these. I also met a lot of old and new friends and have been inspired in many surprising and different ways.</p>
<p>I'd like to highlight a few events that stand out for me personally, but that doesn't mean the others aren't extraordinary and great, just a few stood out a bit more: RSConf in Minsk, DaFED, JSConf UY, MediterraneaJS and JSConf US (Last Call).</p>
<ul>
<li>RSConf was well-done, full of great talks and workshops and speakers, organisers and attendees where great, bright folks and it was a pleasure being among them</li>
<li>DaFED is an exceptional regular meetup run by amazing and lovely folks that gave me an incredibly warm welcome and I am proud to have been part of this incredible event where great minds and enthusiasm come together to create a better future for their local community</li>
<li>JSConf Uruguay had been so supportive to me and managed to balance feeding our brains with inspiring content and making everybody mingle and chat - it has been a blast!</li>
<li>Mediterranea JS was a well-crafted meeting of a lovely bunch of people in Barcelona to discuss tech and community matters that took the best of many other events and combined it in a fruitful gathering that felt like a family meeting, despite the broad range of topics covered</li>
<li>JSConf US, the last call, had all the feels. The brilliant content that pushed things to the edge combined with what matters most in all our lives: Lovely people. It's been a very special event in that it discussed a lot of issues that are bigger than tech. It was focused on enabling people to unfold their full potential, together, as a community. And last but not least: It was a farewell to Laura and Chris, who made all this happen and inspired so many other events and communities to come up and prosper.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all in all, it's been a blast!</p>

<p>I wish you all a calm and joyful time and a good start to a great 2016!
