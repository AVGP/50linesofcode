								<p>#How not to suck on presentations</p>
<p>I have been giving and listening to a bazillion of presentations and talks.</p>&#13;
<p>And it makes me really sad to see bad presentations. Not just because they're bad and you're likely to lose time there - but because I think those presentations could have been so much better by just doing a few really simple things a bit better.</p>&#13;
<p>Usually, when it comes to this, people say you have to have "talent". I disagree.</p>&#13;
<p>Talent helps you to give extraordinary talks, of course. But giving a good talk does not need talent but practice and knowledge about the pitfalls.</p>&#13;
<p>So here we go:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>1. The reader</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You're (most likely) not talking to little kids in preschool age. Your audience is usually capable of reading on their own. Please don't just read your slides. Provide only the key points of your talk on the slides, but build whole sentences and interesting additional information around it - talk about that, not just about the key points. And don't cheat here (I've seen people having a keypoint like "intuitive" and telling the audience: "It's intuitive." and going on with the other keywords like that.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>2. The story</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Talks should evolve. Give a motivation for your talk at the beginning to have your audience knowing why they should pay attention to your following presentation - if they have a really good example or a highly incentive reason for your story, they will be more likely to really follow you there.</p>&#13;
<p>Also please tell a story - behave like you're telling someone you know really good about your topic. You don't stop every few sentences, wait a few seconds and then start like there was nothing before. Connect your slides with some sentences, pick up things you mentioned early (not too often, though).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>3. Acting</strong></p>&#13;
<p>You don't have to be the born actress or actor.</p>&#13;
<p>A lot of people find it hard to speak to a larger group of people. Advices like "imagine them naked" do not work - so what to do?</p>&#13;
<p>Don't worry about getting nervous. It is completely normal. I haven't seen a single speaker so far, who was not nervous at when she or he began their talk. I am freaking out when I enter the stage, believe me.</p>&#13;
<p>The trick is: Don't think about your audience. Just see them as a single person, who begged you for the information you will give in your talk. After all: They decided to visit your talk and if they don't like it, they can leave at any time.</p>&#13;
<p>(Side node: If I know my audience is forced to be there, I tell them to ask questions or tell me, when they get bored. Wasting people's time always sucks)</p>&#13;
<p>Don't be shy. Look at them, try to make them interact with you (raising hands works best.)</p>&#13;
<p>And most important: Talk to them, if they are a person you know. Don't just stand somewhere on the stage, trying to blend in with the wall behind you. Move - walk around (having a presenter to switch slides is wonderful), do some gestures with your hands, modulate your voice. Nothing is worse than a robotic presenter staying around like a statue, monotonously blabbering thru the slides. <strong>Talk with them</strong>.Â </p>&#13;
<p>A presentation is like a talk <strong>without anyone interrupting you</strong>. Use that chance and finally tell them all about the topic you are presenting. They won't interrupt you. They let you finish. That's a <em>bonus</em>!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Following along with these few simple steps and practicing them, your talks will be better and people will like them!</p>
