<p><strong>1.) The Term</strong></p>&#13;
<blockquote><strong><span>The word "community" is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a> <em>communité</em> which is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> <em>communitas</em> (<em>cum</em>, "with/together" + <em>munus</em>, "gift"), a broad term for fellowship or organized society</span></strong><strong><span>(source: </span></strong><span><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community">Wikipedia</a></span><strong><span>)</span></strong></blockquote>&#13;
<p><span>This is not the only definition for "community" - but this is the definition, I'll rely on in this post.</span><span>In past eras, a community was based primarily on the geographical location. Going in more detail, a community (speaking of cities, kingdoms, countries) could at some point be split into sub-communities. For example countries were communities sharing a broadly defined common geographical area, some cultural aspects (for example a common language). They can be split in smaller units, each of which is a community itself - let it be considered a community from the point of sharing the same regency (kingdoms, duchies, counties, etc.) or a finer defined common location (cities, townships, etc) or defined by cultural aspects (churches, language-dialects, etc.).</span><span>So you have some kind of hierarchy of communities, having their source from - to get on the lowest [when higher granularity of definition means a higher level of hierarchy) layer of this hierarchy - the planet earth)</span><span>So you have a structure like the following:</span></p>&#13;
<ol><li><span>Earthlings</span></li>&#13;
<li><span>Communities by continent</span></li>&#13;
<li><span>Communities by country</span></li>&#13;
<li><span>etc.</span></li>&#13;
</ol><p><strong>2. Virtual Communities and the need for clearer specification</strong><br /><span>Nowadays, we have virtual communities and dozens of them, adding additional higher layers.</span><span>We have Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Tumblr, Flickr, Latitude, Bulletin-boards, etc.</span><br /><span>And here we go: Considering the term "community" with the definition from above is difficult.</span><span>I suggest a classification using the following types of communities:</span></p>&#13;
<ul><li><span><em>topic-centered</em> community</span></li>&#13;
<li><span><em>people-centered</em> community</span></li>&#13;
</ul><p>This seems unclear at first, but it reflects the nature of the communities, I think.</p>&#13;
<p>Lets take two examples: Twitter and Latitude.</p>&#13;
<p>Twitter is a <em>topic-centered</em> community in my opinion.</p>&#13;
<p>I read the tweets from people, I mostly don't know personally. They belong to my network in this community, because I like the <em>topics</em> they're proficient in or at least sharing information about. This is, why the "retweet"-feature is so popular - the main point in a tweet is not its origin, but its content, its <em>topic</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>I wouldn't share something too personal here, because everyone can read it. And to most of them - not knowing me - it would be uninteresting though. So I concentrate on sharing interesting things. Things I stumbled upon on the net, thoughts regarding a specific topic, solutions to problems I encountered and so on.</p>&#13;
<p>So I share and interact about <em>topics.</em></p>&#13;
<p>Latitude is different, it is a <em>people-centered </em>community.</p>&#13;
<p>Obviously I don't care about where someone I don't even know is. And neither do I want some foreigner to know where I am. But its nice to see, where my friends are staying around and to let them know, where I am at the moment. So I may look up, who is in proximity at some point in time and take this as an impulse to do spend some time together.</p>&#13;
<p>I share things and interact about <em>people</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>As so often in life, its not only black&amp;white.. what about Facebook and the others?</p>&#13;
<p>Personally, I am using them different. Facebook for example is mostly used by me for keeping in touch with colleagues and friends of mine. Anyway, I also keep in touch with organizations and things I like. So its a bit of both worlds.</p>&#13;
<p>I would love to hear about your thoughts regarding this topic!</p>
