								<p>#Voodoo-Solutions</p>
<p>Today I wanna introduce the term "Voodoo-Solution" to the public.</p>&#13;
<p>Certainly you know this kind of solution to a specific problem*.</p>&#13;
<p>Nowadays, if you run into a problem and can't solve it on your own in a reasonable amount of time, you search the web for a solution. To get this right: The web is just enlarging the scope of this phenomenon - it exists since people talk about problems and their solutions, I believe.</p>&#13;
<p>When crawling through the search results, you may find a vast amount of different solutions - and some of them are what I refer to as <strong><em>Voodoo-Solutions</em></strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>What renders these solutions special is the fact, that they include unrelated-seeming steps (often <em>lots</em> of these) and only work for a small group of people - and what is the most interesting fact: If you re-enact them with some changes, they still work. Its also possible, that re-enacting them the <em>exact same way</em> may not work <em>again</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>Basically, <strong>Vodoo-Solutions</strong> are based upon the desperate, strenuous efforts to solve the problem. In this process one may reach the <em>point of Voodoo.</em> The one in need of the problem will <em>try any possible and <strong>impossible </strong></em>way to get to a solution.</p>&#13;
<p>This leads to a tremendous amount of steps to be taken to get it done. Usually, once a working solution is found, the wish and will to strap down the solution to the necessary steps is close to zero - and here we are: The birth of a <em><strong>Voodoo-Solution</strong></em>.</p>&#13;
<p>A Voodoo-Solution might look like this:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>To get it working, just unplug the device, uninstall all the drivers, then load up your browser and delete the cache and the cookies. Then uninstall the device's software. Afterwards restart the computer and wait a few minutes. Now plug in the device, let the driver-dialog stay open but don't install the drivers yet. First install the device-software. Then install the drivers, unplug and re-plug the device again, restart the computer - and you're done!</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>The thing about Voodoo-Solutions is: <strong>Sometimes</strong>, even when including several unrelated-seeming steps, <strong>they are the way to go</strong> and get things to work properly.</p>&#13;
<p>I think its best, to stay easy with these things and keep a smile. For example, I refer to this kind of solution with sentences like:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>"You need to wait for the next moon-eclipse, then eat some strawberry-jam on midnight, then start the process while jumping from left to right and vice versa, while having your feet strapped together with some duct-tape. That'll work!".</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>So long folks, hope you enjoyed this little post and remember it when you come across the next <em>Voodoo-Solution</em>. ;)</p>&#13;
<p>*) Especially, when you've been fiddling with Bluetooth or Java - or worse: Both in combination!</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Addendum: </strong>To get this clear - I'm not ranting about people posting what I consider "Voodoo-Solutions"! Better a Voodoo-Solution than no solution at all! And of course: I am posting this kind of solution from time to time, too, when the problem gives me no other possibility or I am just too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to strap the solution down to the bare necessities.</p>
