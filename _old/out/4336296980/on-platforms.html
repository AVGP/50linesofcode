<p>The term "platform technology" refers to technologies with the primary purpose of allowing people to use it as the base of derivative work. The most obvious example is the operating system on the computer. It is providing the base for all the applications by organizing all the ressources and providing a user interface which is used by the applications then. But also libraries, frameworks and toolkits are platform technologies, providing the developer with a foundation for adding purpose to it.</p>&#13;
<p>But what makes a platform a <em>good</em> platform?</p>&#13;
<p>In my opinion a good platform, before anything else, needs to be <strong>available</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>Availability hereby means being freely available for end-users and developers. It should not take any prerequirements to get hold of a copy of the platform.</p>&#13;
<p>It should also be <strong>transparent</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>Transparency means, there is no digital-rights-mumbo-jumbo involved and I can modify or contribute to the platform itself. Combining the availability of the sources and the possibility to contribute to the platform it is nice to have the project set up on github or gitosis, for example.</p>&#13;
<p>To get best results with considerable effort, it needs to be <strong>well-documented</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p>While some people just like to work with a specific platform, others may <em>have to</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>Good platforms don't give these people a hard time, good platforms make it a joy to use them. Good documentation is also a necessity to get people to work with the platform, improve and contribute to it.</p>&#13;
<p>A platform that is not adopted by a reasonable amount of users and developers is not getting anywhere - it will die at some future point.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A pretty example of a good platform would be <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/paniq">paniq</a>'s "Datenwerk" library.</p>&#13;
<p>It is publicly available for free and the documentation is awesome. The library itself is clean and straight forward, which makes it joyful to use.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What do you think, should a good platform also provide?</p>
