								<p>#The bad, the good, the masterpieces
Building websites and web applications is a craft. And as far as crafts go, there will always be bad, mediocre and great pieces.</p>
<p>The question is, what makes something a masterpiece? Is it the techniques applied, the perfect mastery of them, the little details?</p>
<p>Coming back from Rome again, a city full of various disciplines master pieces, I have gained a better understanding.</p>
<p>Though it's hard for me to grasp the entire cleverness and knowledge that contribute to the overall results of each of them, certain patterns and aspects can be found repeatedly on most, if not all, of them.</p>
<p>It's usually neither one aspect, nor all of them together, it's the consistency in the impression that is created in the observer.</p>
<p>There is a lot of different aspects that come into play there, for example</p>
<ul>
<li>Color theory</li>
<li>Use of fore- and background, as well as the space in between</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Guidance of the viewers' eyes</li>
<li>Technique</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a developer striving to learn about design, it came as a surprise to me, that the techniques used and how well they were mastered by the artist are not the most important aspect that makes something a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Looking at a lot of mediocre, some most-popular and some less popular but extraordinarily intriguing items, I figured that mostly three things caught my eyes and captured my attention for more then the average time span:</p>
<ol>
<li>The colors and contrasts</li>
<li>The composition of the piece</li>
<li>The guidance of view</li>
</ol>
<p>The amazing thing I never noticed before: That also worked, when proportions where slightly off, or there were minor defects (e.g. broken off parts of a statue or parts of the canvas) or missing details, etc.</p>
<p>I did notice these deficiencies, though I was standing there, admiring the overall impression they made on me.</p>
<p>I had to look at a bunch of those pieces and it was only at the Vatican museums, where most of the art was related to Christianity and there were a lot of more-or-less comparable works to gaze upon, or downright <em>staring</em> at them for pretty long, to gain the insights, that it's the above-mentioned three things (in the order I put them) that attracts people.</p>
<p>I even watched others and how they looked at the different things and how their eyes were moving around.</p>
<p>After getting this invaluable &quot;Heureka&quot; moment, I am now looking differently at designs and art, whether it's a famous painting, an anchient statue or something profane as a website or a web application, because this simple finding applies to all of them:</p>
<p><strong>You don't have to do everything 100% perfectly, as long as you put effort in how the spectator reacts to it and is engaged with it and get it <em>pretty right</em>.</strong></p>
