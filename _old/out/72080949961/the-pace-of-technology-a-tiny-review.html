								<p>#The pace of technology - a tiny review
I'd just like to give you an idea of the velocity of change in technology and how much of an impact this has on our everyday life.</p>
<p>When I had my first computer experience on a Commodore 64 I was learning everything from a book. <strong>A book</strong> that had a few hundred pages printed on paper.</p>
<p>The best I could get were a few programs written in BASIC or, later, assembly language. They could draw stuff on screen, react to keyboard or joystick input and were rather simple games.</p>
<p>Then I got a PC. If I wanted it to do something new I'd go to a shop, buy a bunch of CDs and install the software. After <strong>a few hours</strong> (taking the time to go to the shop until the program was running for the first time) you then had a shiny new toy.</p>
<p>Then I learned programming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>s. That was a very different experience, as it is much more event-driven than the classical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>-style programs I wrote.</p>
<p>Back then the only way I could exchange my software with others was a <strong>floppy disk</strong> with the <strong>CD writer</strong> just being the hottest (and pretty expensive) piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Then I finally came online - and it was a revolution: I could run a small website with my software on it and <strong>within weeks a few hundred people were running code that I had written</strong>.</p>
<p>I could exchange information within a blink of the eye, download new software, learn a new trick in software development and distribute my work worldwide - <strong>new things were minutes away</strong>.</p>
<p>Then I built a few tools myself to share pictures, ebooks, texts and hosted them myself as <strong>services just started to pop up</strong> throughout the net.</p>
<p>Back then I switched from a few megabytes shared web space to a <strong>virtual server</strong>. It would cost around 15â‚¬/month and it took a contract and a few days to set up.</p>
<p>Then the <strong>cloud era</strong> began.</p>
<p>You could now spin up and shut down servers as you went along. <strong>It took a click</strong>. No paperwork, no waiting.
And with <strong>servers becoming a commodity</strong>, services became a commodity, too.</p>
<p>I didn't have to host my software, my code, my pictures, music books or anything else myself anymore - it was a matter of clicks now.</p>
<p>And this is today - things that required knowledge of how to run a server or how to configure a whole range of pieces to get something online are now easily and readily available for almost everybody.</p>
<p>But as a word of warning: <strong>We need to make sure it stays that way</strong>.
I highly encourage you to look at the <a href="https://unhosted.org/">unhosted initiative</a>, at the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">indie web</a> and interesting projects such as the <a href="http://indiephone.eu/">indie phone</a>.</p>
