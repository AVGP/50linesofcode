								<p>#Why developers should learn to estimate and estimate often
Developers are sometimes a grumpy set of people.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, I understand my fellow developers - deadlines are tight, features creep in and out from time to time and uncertainty is your daily companion.</p>
<p>Asking the right questions before starting to hack away is crucial but pretty hard at the same time.</p>
<p>It's hard, because it's likely that you never did something alike and before sitting down and thinking it through carefully it's hard to ask the interesting questions to other stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>So why would you do that?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, estimations help everyone to <strong>get the expectations straight</strong>.
That tough deadline is in two weeks but the estimated work says 2 months? Well, then there's some sort of problem and you should talk about that.</p>
<p>The work is finished faster than expected? Well, then you may have a problem as well (somebody may have missed important bits &amp; pieces or the code is poorly written, docs may be missing, ...)</p>
<p><strong>What can be the reasons that estimations are wrong?</strong></p>
<p>There's a pretty long list. My top 3:</p>
<p>1.) The task wasn't thought-through. Sub-task were missed, uncertainties weren't identified or the requirements weren't documented.
2.) A lack of experience. It takes some try&amp;error to get a feeling for the common tasks and problems.
3.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep">Scope creep</a> happened between the estimation and the (delayed) delivery.</p>
<p>Yes, in <strong>that</strong> particular order.</p>
<p><strong>How do do better estimations?</strong></p>
<p>That's not a one-shot thing. It took me a couple of attempts to get to acceptable and apropriate estimations for different tasks. Basically you oscillate around the right estimation - sometimes you're over, sometimes you're under, but you should always aim to make it as close as possible.
If you get your performance to +/- 5%, you're good.
For example: In sprints of one week I tried to be within 2 hours of my estimations. I am pretty sure I never reached that goal, but I wasn't too bad at it (I think).</p>
