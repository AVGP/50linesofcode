								<p>#End of year 2014 - an end and a new beginning</p>
<p>So, I think it&#8217;s time to wrap up 2014.</p>
<p>The year has been a blast and I&#8217;m very grateful for the people I met and my friends and family for making this year so wonderful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/webcomponents">an ebook on web components</a> which has sold 208 times so far.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to be part of <a href="http://www.codebits.eu">Codebits VII</a>, together with my friends and former colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/balgan">Balgan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/skylept">Rafael</a> and Pedro(<a href="https://twitter.com/pfcabrita">https://twitter.com/pfcabrita</a>) - it&#8217;s been an honour to join the Security CTF with these guys and we made 2nd place, being 1st just until a few seconds before the end.</p>
<p>I also gave my &#8220;Build your own OS for fun and profit&#8221; talk in Lisbon and met a bunch of lovely people (e.g. the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/daviddias">David</a> and the famous <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8">Christian Heilmann</a>.</p>
<p>In May I had the chance to meet the brilliant community and conference-hosting genius <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickHeneise">Patrick</a> in Barcelona and get to know <a href="https://twitter.com/Smutchings">Sam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/franciov">Francisco</a> who showed me around the vibrant and beautiful Barcelona.</p>
<p>In Barcelona I had the chance to talk about <a href="http://futurejs.org">web components at FutureJS</a> and <a href="http://wenode.barcelonajs.org/">the MEAN Stack at WeNode</a> where I met a bunch of lovely, smart people.</p>
<p>A week later I was invited to the 2014 edition of <a href="http://">The Geek Gathering</a> in Croatia. I spend a lovely day in Zagreb before meeting the folks in Osijek - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/amlinarev">Andrej</a>, Dennis and all the others for The Geeks Gathering and thanks in particular to my friends in Osijek over at <a href="http://lovelyhq.com/">Lovely HQ</a>, yes, I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="https://twitter.com/mdjanic">Mario</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MarinaObsivac">Marina</a> :)</p>
<p>Then the next special shoutout goes to the Swiss (JS) developer community and the <a href="http://www.frontendconf.ch">Frontend Conf</a> crowd. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/shvi">Pierre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lejoe">Joel</a> for making the various meetups in and around Zurich happen that I had the pleasure to attend, meeting nice folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/stefffi">Steffi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m">Gregor</a> or <a href="http://">Philip</a> among so many others (sorry for not listing you all here)!</p>
<p>I also had the chance to visit a few nice german developer conferences and different crowds at <a href="http://enterjs.de">enterJS</a> where I met <a href="https://twitter.com/asciidisco">Sebastian</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fhemberger">Frederic</a>.</p> I also spoke at the Mobile App Europe and the Dev.Talks, both of which was nice and interesting. 
<p>I also had a visit from <a href="http://twitter.com/badboy_">Jan-Erik</a> here in Zurich and met the brilliant Googler <a href="https://twitter.com/zekjur">Michael</a> over a burger</p>. 
<p>I also left Centralway to continue my ongoing journey to support and foster the open web, its ecosystem and the community. I am very happy to have found the amazing team at [Archilogic] (http://archilogic.com) and that I am now part of the endeavours to push the web in general and WebGL in particular to new frontiers.
for instance I got to work with the Oculus Rift and the experimental <a href="http://webglvr.tumblr.com">WebVR</a> API.
Amazing stuff coming out soon and I'm happy to be aboard of such a wonderful team!</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to meet the lovely and welcoming developer community in Amsterdam for the <a href="http://devfest.nl">DevFest NL</a>, it's been nice to meet so many lovely folks and it was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Then, last but not least, this year I got to work with a bunch of great people, some of which are still in Zurich, some of which aren't. Of those who haven't been mentioned yet, I'd like to particularly give a shoutout to my former team lead <a href="https://twitter.com/olivertupman">Ollie</a> and my mentor and team mate <a href="https://twitter.com/igama">Marco</a> as well as the seasoned <a href="https://twitter.com/timd">Tim</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drcursor">Eduardo</a>; I learnt an awful lot from these people.</p>
<p>It has been a great year and I hope (and believe) 2015 will be a great year as well.</p>
<p>On to the next big adventures we shall roam! A happy new year to y'all!</p>
