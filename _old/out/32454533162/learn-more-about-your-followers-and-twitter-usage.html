								<p>#Learn more about your followers and twitter usage</p>
<p>Social Media is a hot topic nowadays, even if you're not a company trying to sell something. Understanding your followers and your own behaviour can be interesting and helpful, if you want to expand your reach or get stronger connections to the people communicating with you - especially turning a passive audience into an active one.</p>&#13;
<p>In this article I want to show you three of them I found to be useful, primarily for Twitter.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong><a href="http://schmap.it">Schmap</a> - who are your "followers", what are they looking for?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>At the beginning of your personal Twitter usage you are likely to know the people behind the avatar pictures and nicknames, but eventually you reach the point where you don't know every single follower.</p>&#13;
<p>At some point it may be helpful to learn more about your followers to find those, who may be interesting to follow, to talk with or to focus on.</p>&#13;
<p>This discovery may as well help you find out, what the topics your followers are actually interested in and what backgrounds they may have (which helps you focus on interesting content and pick the right words for your communication).</p>&#13;
<p>For example: If you run an automotive startup, you may think your followers are interested in you talking about automotive stuff, but in reality you have more followers looking for startup related information. You may not get customers from your followers, but maybe there are some Venture Capitalists just sitting there reading - waiting for you to try to "activate" them! Would you like to miss out on that?</p>&#13;
<p>In addition, Schmap.it tells you where your followers come from - so you can get a basic idea where your peers sit. If you travel to some place and know, that many of your followers (supposedly) are there, why not ask them for a meetup or some cool special tips and spots to check out?</p>&#13;
<p>Schmap makes this pretty simple and quick: You authorize them to access your twitter account and they present you with a comprehensive overview of your followers by job, topics, gender and country, region and city and some more factors.</p>&#13;
<p><img height="500" src="http://i.imgur.com/LeWBn.png" width="500" /></p>&#13;
<p>I found this to be really use- and helpful and easy to use to get a better feeling for your followers.</p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong><a href="https://www.twentyfeet.com">Twentyfeet</a> - keep an eye on trends and metrics</strong></p>&#13;
<p>How often have you been mentioned in the last week? How about the last month?</p>&#13;
<p>How many followers have you lost - and who unfollowed you?</p>&#13;
<p>These questions and many more can be answered and monitored using Twentyfeet.</p>&#13;
<p>It gives you a whole bunch of graphs where you can see, how you performed on Twitter (and/or Facebook) recently (you can pick the exact period of time).</p>&#13;
<p>You can also request a weekly digest that sums up the most interesting developments (e.g. exceptionally high number of mentions, exceptionally low number of new followers, etc.) and you get an "activity stream" aside all the graphs to grasp the key changes and developments at a short glance.</p>&#13;
<p>This tool helps to monitor your interactions with the audience and the ability to see who's unfollowed you is useful to related the fluctuations in the bare number of followers Twitter gives you.</p>&#13;
<p>The email notifications come in handy, if you are - like me - only using Twitter for fun, a little networking and knowledge gathering. For more professional users, the CSV- and Excel-Exports</p>&#13;
<p>may be useful when external reporting has to be done.</p>&#13;

<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong><a href="http://www.tweetstats.com/">Tweetstats</a>Â - a little nerdier: When do you (or someone else) tweet about what?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>This one is slightly nerdier than the other two tools, as it throws tons of bar charts at you.</p>&#13;
<p>The biggest difference is, that it doesn't need authorization to gather the information it evaluates - you can evaluate any twitter user (except for protected users) - when do they tweet?</p>&#13;
<p>How often do the tweet over time and weekday (e.g. I am tweeting quite frequently on Monday noons, Tuesday afternoons and Friday evenings, most tweets are created on Tuesdays and on 5 pm.</p>&#13;
<p>You can also see, who you retweeted or mentioned most frequently and what interfaces you use how often (e.g. web / mobile phone, some desktop client, etc.).</p>&#13;
<p>A nice feature is the hashtag map that shows your most frequent hashtags used.</p>&#13;
<p><img height="256" src="http://i.imgur.com/Esu9q.png" width="400" /></p>&#13;
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>So where is Klout?</strong></p>&#13;
<p>To be honest here - I don't see much value in the abstract score that Klout provides you.</p>&#13;
<p>The latest preview at least drills down where this nebulous score comes from (e.g. 60% Twitter, 40% Facebook) or something. It still does not tell me: "Your score went down, because the number of retweets had plunged" or any other information. This means that identifying the cause for changes in the score are guess work. Something that analytics tools should take away from you.</p>&#13;
<p>The list of stories sorted by engagement of the audience on the other hand is nice but not really useful as well - I can see that directly on the platforms and I will find out about that just by being informed from the platforms directly. As I want to communicate and interact with people engaged in something I posted, I will follow those anyway.</p>&#13;
<p>By the way, there is a funny service called Klouchebag that shows you your "social media asshattery" - at the time of this writing it qualifies me as "quite noisy". I should watch out here, I guess ;-)</p>
