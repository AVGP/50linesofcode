## TL;DR


## What is Polymer?

Polymer isn't a framework but a library of helpers, ready-made components and tooling around working with web components.
I really like this approach, because you get to pick just what you need from Polymer:

* You can use only the components to save you time of writing UI or logic components that already exist
* You can only reach for the components to generate beautiful documentation or the test helpers for your own web components
* You may as well see Polymer as a way to reduce the boilerplate you have to write to create your own web components
* Polymers build tooling and components for libraries and services (e.g. pouchdb or firebase) are super rad to get good quality web components into production quicker.
* If you have your own bunch of components and tooling already, but need some data binding glue, Polymer can be used for that as well

So in short: Pick what you need, Polymer is pretty rad and pretty modular, too.

## What's new in Polymer 2.0?

To summarize: Polymer 2.0 is a much thinner wrapper around the Web Component specifications and a more performant and lean approach to bundling Polymer's functionality up.

Polymer 1.x was based on version zero of the Web Components specifications. These never shipped (well, Firefox had some of it behind a flag) to browsers other than Chrome and Opera,
so a Polyfill was needed and that's not going to change.
However, browser vendors came to an agreement over version one of the specs, so Polymer 2.0 is using these instead.
