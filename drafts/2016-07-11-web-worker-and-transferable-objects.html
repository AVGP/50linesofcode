<!-- Web worker and transferable objects -->

* When using a worker, data is being copied
* There are "transferable objects" that do not get copied, but referenced
* Downside: The main thread loses access to the data
* Upside: The memory overhead is much much lower
* FYI: The speed is the same, though (but I should try this on mobile...)
