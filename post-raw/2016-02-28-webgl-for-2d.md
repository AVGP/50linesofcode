# WebGL for 2D Graphics

## Preface

WebGL is known for providing great, fine-grained GPU access to create high-performance 3D graphics on the web.
It's less obvious and hence lesser known that it also brings some nice possibilities for 2D graphics.

In addition to the possibilities it brings, I also believe it provides an easier introduction path to WebGL as
it reduces the moving targets by one dimension.
