<!-- SEO codelabs for developers -->

SEO and web development are two ingredients to successful websites, if done right.
As one of my goals this year is to make SEO more approachable to web developers,
I wanted to create interactive tutorials to help everyone who wants to learn more
about how to make websites more discoverable via Search and I believe codelabs are
a great way to do that, so I sat together with [Lizzi](https://twitter.com/lizziharvey) 
to create a few codelabs!

## Our brand new codelabs

![Try the codelabs right from your browser!](/images/post-images/codelabs.png)

We came up with two completely fresh codelabs that we're pretty proud of:

- [Fix a single-page app for Google Search](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/making-a-single-page-app-search-friendly)
- [Implement dynamic rendering with Rendertron](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/dynamic-rendering/)

We also took a look at the existing structured data codelab and updated it, so [check out the Structured Data codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/), too!
Each codelab allows you to let us know if there's something that needs improvement and we're happy to hear your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/g33konaut)!

If you're at Google I/O this year, you can also go and do the codelabs there!

Have fun and enjoy :)
