I will be at Google I/O this week! If you wanna meet up or talk to me, you will have many opportunities to do so :)

## Tuesday: Floating around

On Tuesday I will most likely hang around the community lounge and the web sandbox :)

## Wednesday: Web AMA and office hours

On Wednesday, I will be part of two sessions:
 * 1:50pm - 2:30pm - [Web Team AMA](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/5d502586-69dd-4926-b62f-60795df643ce) at the community lounge
 * 3:30pm - 4:30pm - [JS SEO office hourse](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/92172f84-c703-4377-b54a-7976bbdf7796-bundle) at the Office Hours pavillon

I will most likely also hang around the web sandbox and community lounge as well!

## Thursday: Talks, a roundtable and office hours

There will be additional [Web and Search office hours](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/7b13f50f-f5f9-4be4-af1d-e87717c067c1-bundle) at 8:30am.
I will also host a [SEO & Webdev roundtable](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/b5e26484-fdb1-49df-9912-091d19b36476) at the community lounge, starting at 12:40.

In addition I have the honor to present two sessions around Google Search:

* Thursday, 10:30am, Stage 8: [**Google Search: State of the union**](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/280ec615-7a63-420a-9e74-05428da072f9)
* Thursday, 1:30pm, Stage 3: [**Google Search <3 JavaScript sites**](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/da7ca544-1260-4940-88c6-e74dbf49a80a) 

So if you are at I/O, I'd be happy to see you in the audience :)

## What about you?

If you're at I/O and would like to meet, either pop by at any of those sessions or [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/g33konaut) if you'd like to meet!

Cheers and see you soon,
