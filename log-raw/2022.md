- Dry suit course DM'ing for Maik. Three nice students, surprisingly nice viz at WZT
- 3D printed a hose clip (but for the wrong boltsnaps...Mares...) and a little case for the ESP32 (but forgot that Micro-USB plugs are bigger than their snout) and Anne designed and printed a cutting board rack. That's some cool shit!
