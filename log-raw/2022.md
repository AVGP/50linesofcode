# January

- Neat first dive at BauschÃ¤nzli. But no current? My ass - quite some current today :D Found bikes, scooters, etc.
- Dry suit course DM'ing for Maik. Three nice students, surprisingly nice viz at WZT
- 3D printed a hose clip (but for the wrong boltsnaps...Mares...) and a little case for the ESP32 (but forgot that Micro-USB plugs are bigger than their snout) and Anne designed and printed a cutting board rack. That's some cool shit!
- A bunch of nice apartments are showing up on the market. Keeping fingers crosssseeeddd!
- Got the display and the ESP32 as well as the Arduino to work together quite nicely :)

- Did the DAD webinar and Annick told me that they'll figure out how to make me a DAD SPE once I got my IDC...yaay!
- The big purge is happening. Feels good to throw all that shit away :D
- Booked Advanced Nitrox + Helitrox with Tom in March. And ice divinnnnggggg
- Contract arrived and we had a really nice DSD. 
- Got a drone, tried it at Ermitage. Fun! 
- Dive at Ermitage, could have been nicer, I tried the D10 and trim was real bad. 
- Solo dive at Ermitage + drone footage + timelapse - fun stuff and saw lots of crayfish, the chalk wall and awww

- What a day at ZigeunerplÃ¤tzli... first Sergio forgot his undergarments and then Katja had a hole in her wrist seal :( But Ana and I had a lovely dive there

- Fun dive day at Rorschach HB with Annette, Emily, Susanne and Jan! Great dive site, we'll be back!
- Lunchtime dive at ZollbrÃ¼cke with Sonja, then a night dive at Ermitage with Annette. Annette didn't like the dive much, but I had a good time.
- Coffee with Monika (Bao is apparently in puberty now, oh my!) and game night with Aurora and Ciaran - Jasssssssssing the night away!
- Lovely DSD with Jussi and Helka. Helka didn't seem too excited about it, Jussi thorougly enjoyed it tho!
- Great dive with Sergio at Riedsort. Crashed the drone into the water, oh noo...
