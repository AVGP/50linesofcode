- Neat first dive at BauschÃ¤nzli. But no current? My ass - quite some current today :D Found bikes, scooters, etc.
- Dry suit course DM'ing for Maik. Three nice students, surprisingly nice viz at WZT
- 3D printed a hose clip (but for the wrong boltsnaps...Mares...) and a little case for the ESP32 (but forgot that Micro-USB plugs are bigger than their snout) and Anne designed and printed a cutting board rack. That's some cool shit!
- A bunch of nice apartments are showing up on the market. Keeping fingers crosssseeeddd!
- Got the display and the ESP32 as well as the Arduino to work together quite nicely :)
- We got the new apartment ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
- I got a flu-ish cold :(
