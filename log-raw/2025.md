- started slowww, but really nice :) Breakfast with Annette and Anne, then cuddling, playing video games, relaxing :)
- beautiful dive at Rheinau with Annette, Anne wandered down the river for a bit, we ate at Hans im Glück and we shopped and went home through the pouring rain.
- lost day. Went to dive at Rütenen, but forgot the gloves. Wanted to get stuff done on a site or videos, didn't happen. Tired, unfocused. Mh :(
- Good DSD with Titus and Amos, his son. We had a lot of fun :) Then drove to Konstanz with Annette to pick stuff up, good day. Evening with Anne and Helldivers :)
- Good DSD with Manuela's boyfriend, then Firehouse Sub and then WZT with Annette. So happy that I went, despite feeling tired. New gloves are staying dry, we had TONS of fish but also tons of trash :(
- Went out to Sihlsee with Anne, scouting for the ice diving. Good chats, beautiful landscapes, HD II in the evening, lovely :)
- Back to the office - took the drone up and got a gorgeous sunrise! Then a productive day. Me likey.
- Shitty day. Rainy, tired, gloomy, bad food in the office. meh.
- Good day, dived with Patrizia at Kleiner Parkplatz, said hello to Oski. Good afternoon with Anne and a lovely, calm evening.
- Fun day with Anne - went to Konstanz, then HELLDIVERRRRSSS - Level 10 isn't too bad...
- Pool day with Ana went really well, I hope we get to dive more. Visited Annette and brought her packages. Then cuddling with Anne :3
- Ice diving. Mh. We did get under the ice, I did twice in fact. But vis was super low and we didn't proceed much. Lunch, investigating how to get into Hundlochquelle and that's been a good day.
- Try Sidemount with Sebastian lead to a booked Sidemount course plus a bought XDeep Stealth, yay! Then a lovely afternoon with Anne <3
