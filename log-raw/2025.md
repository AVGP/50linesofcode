# January
- started slowww, but really nice :) Breakfast with Annette and Anne, then cuddling, playing video games, relaxing :)
- beautiful dive at Rheinau with Annette, Anne wandered down the river for a bit, we ate at Hans im Glück and we shopped and went home through the pouring rain.
- lost day. Went to dive at Rütenen, but forgot the gloves. Wanted to get stuff done on a site or videos, didn't happen. Tired, unfocused. Mh :(
- Good DSD with Titus and Amos, his son. We had a lot of fun :) Then drove to Konstanz with Annette to pick stuff up, good day. Evening with Anne and Helldivers :)
- Good DSD with Manuela's boyfriend, then Firehouse Sub and then WZT with Annette. So happy that I went, despite feeling tired. New gloves are staying dry, we had TONS of fish but also tons of trash :(
- Went out to Sihlsee with Anne, scouting for the ice diving. Good chats, beautiful landscapes, HD II in the evening, lovely :)
- Back to the office - took the drone up and got a gorgeous sunrise! Then a productive day. Me likey.
