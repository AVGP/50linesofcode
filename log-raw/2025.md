# January
- started slowww, but really nice :) Breakfast with Annette and Anne, then cuddling, playing video games, relaxing :)
- beautiful dive at Rheinau with Annette, Anne wandered down the river for a bit, we ate at Hans im Glück and we shopped and went home through the pouring rain.
- lost day. Went to dive at Rütenen, but forgot the gloves. Wanted to get stuff done on a site or videos, didn't happen. Tired, unfocused. Mh :(
