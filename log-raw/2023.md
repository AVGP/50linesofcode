# January

- Good first dive in Limmat. Vis was so-so, very little current.
- Solo night dive at Baumgaertli was fantastic. So many fishies!!
- Nice day trip with Susanne. Diving Rorschach Bootsrampe, food at Hans im Glueck and picked up uwfun orders.
- Long drive and stressful day but we got to Budapest. Annette's luggage didn't. FUCK.
- Lovely bit of sightseeing in Budapest :)
- FIRST CAVE DIVES - absolutely mind-blowing, so much fun. This was awesome, truly awesome.
- Mine diving day - super cool and interesting, but really challenging and you feel that you get close to your limits. But super fun and pretty.
- Long drive home, but all good. Annette drove Scotty for the first time.
- Back home, took Mika home. Such a cutie pie. Aurora didn't have a good day tho :(
- Nice dive at Zollbruecke Rheinau. Tiny bit of current, reasonable vis and I saw a catfish! I wanted to practice and do a weight check but I really, really needed a restroom at the end. Dang!
- Early morning deco dive at Terlinden. So refreshing - but not exactly relaxing. Black water descent and missed the wall, ended up in the "blue" and had to swim to the wall. No biggie but meh :D The figurines are super creepy, I noticed. Geez!
- Nice lunch with Jan, filling with Flex and then an amazing dive at Ueberlingen Parkhaus Post with Katja!
- Tricky drysuit course.
- Nice sunday dive at Ruetenen. Harsh conditions tho.
