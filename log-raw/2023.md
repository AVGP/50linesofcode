# January

- Good first dive in Limmat. Vis was so-so, very little current.
- Solo night dive at Baumgaertli was fantastic. So many fishies!!
- Nice day trip with Susanne. Diving Rorschach Bootsrampe, food at Hans im Glueck and picked up uwfun orders.
- Long drive and stressful day but we got to Budapest. Annette's luggage didn't. FUCK.
- Lovely bit of sightseeing in Budapest :)
- FIRST CAVE DIVES - absolutely mind-blowing, so much fun. This was awesome, truly awesome.
- Mine diving day - super cool and interesting, but really challenging and you feel that you get close to your limits. But super fun and pretty.
- Long drive home, but all good. Annette drove Scotty for the first time.
- Back home, took Mika home. Such a cutie pie. Aurora didn't have a good day tho :(
- Nice dive at Zollbruecke Rheinau. Tiny bit of current, reasonable vis and I saw a catfish! I wanted to practice and do a weight check but I really, really needed a restroom at the end. Dang!
- Early morning deco dive at Terlinden. So refreshing - but not exactly relaxing. Black water descent and missed the wall, ended up in the "blue" and had to swim to the wall. No biggie but meh :D The figurines are super creepy, I noticed. Geez!
- Nice lunch with Jan, filling with Flex and then an amazing dive at Ueberlingen Parkhaus Post with Katja!
- Tricky drysuit course.
- Nice sunday dive at Ruetenen. Harsh conditions tho.
- Nice, if snowy, dive in Boudry Plage. FAT eglis, the big catfish is still within Bruce. Right glove flooded tho, ugh.
- Fuck it, I'm buying two 80cuft stages.
- Really nice couch day with Anne. We binged Wednesday on Netflix :D
- Lovely dive with Daniel at Terlinden. Vis was pretty bad until ~30m.
- Terrible shitshow in my inbox. No dive but chill evening with Annette and Jan.
- OWD was a breeze, two nice dives at Riedsort. Annette stopped by :)
- Cuddling with Anne. A lot. Still so angry at the shitshow.
- We put up the shelves, lovely stuff! TSK AB has been interesting.
- Twitch felt good, but I'm still somewhat broken from all this shit. Lovely Dunnstigstauchen tho <3
- A lot of trash-taking-out and shuffling around today. Brought stuff back to TSK, picked up Annette, off to Duesseldorf!
- Easy ride, AMAZING day at Boot. Met Anja from tauchen2go, Sebastian and Joana, Harald, lovely folks from Divesoft, amazing peeps at aquamed, great chat with NRC, fun chat with Franz, and a lovely GUE dinner.
- Lovely half-day at boot, half a day of going home. So happy to see Holger :)
- I realise how much I miss couple time with Anne right now. I definitely need to make schedule changes, so Anne and I get more time for us.
