# January

- Good first dive in Limmat. Vis was so-so, very little current.
- Solo night dive at Baumgaertli was fantastic. So many fishies!!
- Nice day trip with Susanne. Diving Rorschach Bootsrampe, food at Hans im Glueck and picked up uwfun orders.
- Long drive and stressful day but we got to Budapest. Annette's luggage didn't. FUCK.
- Lovely bit of sightseeing in Budapest :)
- FIRST CAVE DIVES - absolutely mind-blowing, so much fun. This was awesome, truly awesome.
- Mine diving day - super cool and interesting, but really challenging and you feel that you get close to your limits. But super fun and pretty.
- Long drive home, but all good. Annette drove Scotty for the first time.
- Back home, took Mika home. Such a cutie pie. Aurora didn't have a good day tho :(
