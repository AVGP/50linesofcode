# Day 1

Nothing is missing, but I noticed that I cannot eat the ice cream I bought earlier this week, because it contains milk. Bah :(

## Day 2

I found out that I can't eat the licorice that I love the most, because it contains wax. Ah well. Besides that, feeling good :)

## Day 3

Besides my "Burger Sauce" not being vegan, all good. The burger is pretty great without it, too.
