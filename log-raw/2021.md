# January 

- Lovely dive day with Annette and Jan. Riedsort is beautiful 
- Awesome dive with Annette, Jan and Susanne at Baumgärtli - pikes, Eglis and Trüschen! 
- Another neat dive at Baumgärtli with Susanne, Jan and Gabriel. We went shallow on the left-hand side and were rewarded with lots of pikes :)
- Nice day with Anne - drove to Halbinsel Au, walked around and enjoyed the mystic atmosphere there
- Dive day with Rene at Ermitage in the morning (lots of crayfish and great viz) and Sonja at Baumgärtli in the evening (SO many Trüschen and Nasen and a super curios, big pike)
