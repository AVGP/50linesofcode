# February
- Really nice night dive at Kleiner Parkplatz w/ Annette. We had Pizza afterwards and it's been so chill!
- Nice chat and dive at Kleiner Parkplatz w/ Jan. I did have a near-anxiety attack at 10m for some reason, tho. I think I was still stressed about the candidate interview before the dive :/

- And a night dive with Katja at Terlinden - we saw a Brachsme!! 
- Nice night dive at Riff Williams. Lots of fishhhhh <3
- Got into two... situations... on my way back by Tram from Annette. First two kids acting up, then a weird guy wrangling a crying girl at the Siemens tram station.
- DONE with the NHK instructor! Wheee!
- The dive with Annette at Schoggiwand was SO good. Viz wasn't exactly great, but we had lots of fish and a chocolate smell :D
