# January

- Anne is sick, so I stayed home but joined Jan and Annette at Stars and Stripes for some dinner and Sushi Go Party.
- Nice but short dive with Annette at WZT - she had a weird noise in her exhale CL and we aborted. But viz was quite good!
- Mika is staying at Annette, we're gearing up for departure tomorrow..
