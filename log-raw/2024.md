# January

- Anne is sick, so I stayed home but joined Jan and Annette at Stars and Stripes for some dinner and Sushi Go Party.
- Nice but short dive with Annette at WZT - she had a weird noise in her exhale CL and we aborted. But viz was quite good!
- Mika is staying at Annette, we're gearing up for departure tomorrow..
- Made it with plenty of time. Flight delayed, enjoying ZRH club food and drinks.
- After a ton of delays, we arrived at Nova in pouring rain, lol! Nice island
- Snorkeling is tricky as most of the shallow reef is dead and barren but the outer reef is teeming with life. Rays, sharks, morays, clown fish, a turtle!
- Diving Kudhimaa has been a lovely flashback, Noo Giri was also pretty and I got to see a Mantis shrimp!
- Awesome day with hot tub and reading and snorkeling with Anne 💙💙💙
- Diving broken Rock again, whee - strong current!
- Hot tubbing with Anne 😎😍
