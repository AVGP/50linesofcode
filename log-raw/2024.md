# January

- Anne is sick, so I stayed home but joined Jan and Annette at Stars and Stripes for some dinner and Sushi Go Party.
- Nice but short dive with Annette at WZT - she had a weird noise in her exhale CL and we aborted. But viz was quite good!
- Mika is staying at Annette, we're gearing up for departure tomorrow..
- Made it with plenty of time. Flight delayed, enjoying ZRH club food and drinks.
- After a ton of delays, we arrived at Nova in pouring rain, lol! Nice island
- Snorkeling is tricky as most of the shallow reef is dead and barren but the outer reef is teeming with life. Rays, sharks, morays, clown fish, a turtle!
- Diving Kudhimaa has been a lovely flashback, Noo Giri was also pretty and I got to see a Mantis shrimp!
- Awesome day with hot tub and reading and snorkeling with Anne 💙💙💙
- Diving broken Rock again, whee - strong current!
- Hot tubbing with Anne 😎😍
- Diving a few new sites. Seventh Heaven was so-so, Dhigurah Arches was great tho.
- Anne's bday was a blast. Mizu's chef and staff gave us a private show and it was DELICIOUS too!
- The chefs are the cutest here - so lovely, so caring
- Interesting demos of local customs and crafts here
- The dive center team are soo sweet <3 I'll miss 'em
- UV snorkeling was a mild success. The reef is just really fucked, but the UV works pretty well!
- BACK HOME - what a long day :(
- Lovely rest day at home. Mika the cutie patootie is back <3 Annette misses her already, oooh
- Work. I feel strange. The mood is a bit bleak, thanks to the recent "emails" and I'm not sure I belong here anymore. I'll see what the summit brings and if that changes my heart.
- Myriam will join me for SMX Munich, whee!
- Sick :( I feel sick (and later vomit), have a fever and limb ache and oof, I stay home. No Boot for me :C
- Still a bit sick, but better. Anne is so sweet and I enjoy the warmth we're having together on the couch <3
- Somewhat fit again. Boring day, but I'm accepting my fate. I love spending time with Anne and it's good to have down days.
- Great day. First summit day was lovely, dive with Daniel (Annette called it off after 3 strikes), so many pikes at Kleiner PP!
- Good summit day, we made dumplings. Fun round at Schoggiwand with Daniel. We saw a pike again :D
- Very, very nice TSK "Xmas" dinner :)
- Konstanz-Roadtrip mit Anne <3 <3 <3
- Very easy and fun drysuit course with two lovely guys. Super chill!
- Amazing fan-dive in Rorschach. 10 people! So much fun!
- Lazy, slow day. I'm seriously unhappy with that.
- Flew the drone, got a few amazing shots! Went to Rene for my BZ400 heated and he already gave me the valve and the gloves <3
- Nice flight around Fraumuenster / Grossmuenster. Stressful dive with two kiddies in Kloten. Good evening at home with Anne <3

# February

- Great pool day with my two students for OWD+Dry. Tried Susanne's SM gear at WZT in the evening. Good dive!
- First OW day at WZT. Viz is okay, students doing well. Lovely flight at Eichwald, but the drone somehow got wet?! Nice quick dive there too.
- Second OW day went okay-ish. Valentine quit as she got overwhelmed. Nice afternoon with Annette.
- Lazy Monday. Very tired.
- Great day. Lovely time at work, great dive at a new dive site (Cholplatz). Fun times!
- Super nice day in the office and then with Anne. We went to Lilys and had a fantastic evening together <3 <3 <3
- Long day, but a good evening with Annette and Anne. Early off to the airport, ooof.
- Arrived in Hurghada, the boat is gorgeous!
- Diiiiviiiing in Egypt again <3 Nice reef dive to start things off.
- Lots of great dives from the boat, hate the Zodiac exits tho.
- Got flooded going from Zodiac but got to dive two nice wrecks, oh well
- Really chill and nice reef dive to wrap things up. Saw the remains of a wreck, too.
- Back in ZRH. I missed Anne so much <3 <3 <3
- Fantastic, quiet, cuddly Sunday with Anne :3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
- Slow Monday. Oh my.
- Back to work, full of energy, wheee
- Work work wooork, time with Anne in the evening <3
- BUDAPEST, YAY! Lots of traffic delays, so it took us 14 hours, but it was nice either way.
- GREAT cave dives with Agi. First a pretty normal dive, GoPro had no battery. Oops. Then a REALLY awesome "night dive" (UV lights only) with Agi crowned this day a huge success.
- A lovely dive with Eta and two other guys. Annette was a great model once again :) The second dive with Simi was chaotic. Light failures, valve rolloff, ear issues, oof.
- Fun dive with Joszi. Deeper, tighter, longer... great footage!
- Nice, short ride back with Anne. We took 11 1/2 hours only and got Mika back. She was super cuddly.
- Early start to transfer via CDG to GRU. Oof.
